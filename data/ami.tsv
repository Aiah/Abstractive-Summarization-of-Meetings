Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project. so we're designing a new remote control and um Um, as you can see it's supposed to be original, trendy and user friendly. Um and so there are three different stages to the design. So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it. And repeat that process three times. So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it. My favourite animal is like A beagle. Uh, right, well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family. And, yeah that they have lots of personality Well, my favourite animal would be a monkey. Then they're small cute and furry, and I kind of like whales. They come in and go eat everything in sight. M my favourite animal is my own dog at home. Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you,	The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed what they liked about the animal.
Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro, And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros, so fifty percent of the selling price. but selling price is is that wholesale or retail? I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want. Um. I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all? Like how much does, you know, a remote control cost. Well twenty five Euro, I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something, thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you. Um.	The project manager talked about the project finances and selling prices.
um as well as uh characters, um different uh keypad styles and s symbols. Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh, like with D_V_D_ players, if there are zones. 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages, then you need more buttons. I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region, whereas in another it'll be different, so thinking, 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic, But yeah, I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky. So extra functionalities. So, like, I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market, so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses Right, so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know, do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything? maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots. W You get those ones where you can, if you like, whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep. Maybe we could think about how, could be more, you know, streamlined. S Maybe like a touch screen or something? Or whatever would be technologically reasonable. I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it, I think one factor would be production cost.	The team then discussed various features to consider in making the remote.
I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all? Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh, like with D_V_D_ players, if there are zones.	The remote will be sold on an international scale.
And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros, so fifty percent of the selling price.	The production costs cannot exceed 12.50 Euro.
are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features? So extra functionalities. so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses	Whether the remote will be used exclusively for televisions.
Um so inbetween now and then, um as the industrial designer, you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it	The industrial designer will work on the working design of the remote.
Um for user interface, technical functions,	The user interface designer will work on the technical functions of the remote.
Um and uh marketing executive, you'll be just thinking about what it actually what, you know, what requirements it has to has to fulfil	The marketing executive will work on what requirements the remote has to fulfill
Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro, Well twenty five Euro, I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something,	The remote will sell for 25 Euro.
Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer, Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible. so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go. For example if we had audio controls, those could be something people set up very rarely. Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um, things like channel and volume um are used all the time, so we just have them right out on top, Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls, you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip. and then others that are concealed. So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together, you know.	How to implement the categorization of functions in the design of the remote.
Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising. We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area? um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible. Well, one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types, so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go. Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible. For example if we had audio controls, those could be something people set up very rarely. Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um, things like channel and volume um are used all the time, so we just have them right out on top, Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls, you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip. and then others that are concealed. So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together, you know. Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls? Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories. One would be audio controls, one would be video controls, and the other one would be a device. I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets, right, where we could throw things into, and then from there decide whether it's basic, or it's non-basic. Mm okay, great. shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed, where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is	How to categorize the functions on the remote.
Okay, so fifteen to thirty five, look fairly young. Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket? Yeah, that's good.	The target demographic is people aged fifteen to thirty five.
one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy. And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side, we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands. Um so yeah, I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good,	The remote has to look good and be easy to use.
then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know, we really need to care about. Okay, so just stick to to regular	The remote will use regular batteries.
um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red, so we could stay with tha	The remote will use an infra-red sensor.
Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television, not the V_C_R_, D_V_D_ or anything else. So um, we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_.	The remote will only control televisions.
Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer, Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um, and then others that are concealed. 'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they, you know, w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that. is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some	How to incorporate more advanced functions into the remote while keeping the design and usability of the remote simple.
which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is. so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control.	The team will not work with teletext.
if that's possible we might consider getting into it. Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider? It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying, and 'cause you know, there needs to be some kind of selling point to it. if we are going to include speech recognition, it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that. So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech. so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now, because um, based on what you've go y everybody's saying, right, you want something simple. Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use. Could it be an on off thing? but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology, rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say, and then, you know, say speech recognition is good for this, speech recognition is not good for this. but at end of the day we don't look at the technology, but we look at the function first. is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition, that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well. And also it helps in terms of people not losing this, I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing, so you end up yelling at the control for hours. Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though? I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in.	Whether to include speech recognition as a feature in the remote.
I mean so far I've got um on and off, um switch the channel up and down, and put the volume up and down. and then actual numbers for channels as well, yeah. Um, so so far, just to recap you've got volume and channel control and There's um on and off, um volume and channel, and skip to certain channels with the numbers. I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible. Um on off, up and down channels, up and down volume and uh skip to a channel.	The remote will have buttons for the following functions: on and off, channel up and down, volume up and down, and entering channel numbers.
And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design.	The corporate color and design must be incorporated into the design of the remote.
Well I think it's a valid point. I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated, Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design, you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open, Um, do we have any functions that um we'd want on it? I mean so far I've got um on and off, um switch the channel up and down, and put the volume up and down. and then actual numbers for channels as well, yeah. Um, you say that's a h a required one or a requested one? God, I wou I would say that's required, I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels, uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about, Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising. We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area? um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible. There's um on and off, um volume and channel, and skip to certain channels with the numbers. Um, so so far, just to recap you've got volume and channel control and Well, one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types, so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go. Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible. For example if we had audio controls, those could be something people set up very rarely. Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um, things like channel and volume	The team discussed how to create a remote which did not include the problems present in the existing products presented by the interface specialist.
I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things. what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine, Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been Mm hard to know what where your role ends, yeah. Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing. And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding, 'kay what what are our options, what should we decide So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and what kind of decisions we could take away from it So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs, and what are issues with with um existing products. and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision So this is what I've found here, Um, users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls. Most people find them ugly. Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well, we'll see later, the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control, such as voice recognition. Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls. they tend to use the most simple controls if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations, you know, one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy. And in	The marketing expert presented consumer preferences and requirements and the team discussed who their target demographic should be and whether to include speech recognition in their product.
Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements, which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is. so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control. Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television, not the V_C_R_, D_V_D_ or anything else. I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production, the time to market. So um, we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_. And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design. Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is. It might be yellow, because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere. And the slogan, like the actual written slogan, or just to embody the idea of the slogan? uh th because on the the company website, uh what does it say 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics. I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it, 'cause it's quite long. So those are the three things, just not to worry about teletext, uh only control the T_V_, and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company.	The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote.
Well, um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience, our target market. Um, so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use, but has y is fairly powerful product, whatever, who do we really want to aim that at? Where's the money, maybe. Yeah, who wou who would have the money to spend. it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly, I suppose, Um, I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market, in terms of people. Um so maybe not the high end range, but maybe middle, middle up-ish. Mostly focused around the twenty five age group. Sort of young professional, kind of. Mm-hmm I think we are gonna have to narrow it down, I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well So these are people who are gadgety, right? So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech.	Defining a target demographic.
so this is the technical functions design. to do the um the design I have I've had a look online, I've had a look at the homepage, Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer Um, having a look at the existing products, I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes, there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons, lots of colours, very confusing, you don't know what you're doing. Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad. here um the button there and there. That one's perg and that one's prog, and it doesn't really tell you what it does. Um, not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example. Um it's a very simple one. It's got only the basic functions mm but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one. Uh it looked a bit clunky. They're very big and not very much use for buttons. and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions. Um, my own preferences, I prefer the the clunky one. Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer, So, now I'd like to ask for your preferences. Which which is the clunky one, the one on left or on the right?.. Um, the clunky one is the one on the right. Um I think it's supposed to be the same size, but um it's got much fewer buttons. and then others that are concealed.	The user interface designer presented two existing products and discussed what was wrong with each product.
um for uh our Industrial Designer, you're gonna be thinking about the components concept.	The industrial designer will work on the components concept.
Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface,	The user interface designer will work on the user interface.
Well this is just the working design um. Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now, but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil, like I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are. Has to change channels, has to change volume, but in like specifics, right, which one of the basics are you trying to target. so I'll go into the diagram first. It just explains how the process goes through, from the basic technology point of view, the basic steps that you need you need some power source. 'Kay, a battery or something, to keep it going. Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last. Like for example, voice recognition, right. That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone, so that's one perhaps constraint there. Th Okay, the basic thing is there's a user interface You know, and that um picks up an input from a user, a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device, Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself like um voice recognition, right, if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power. maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are? Well, do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then? Yeah, w I'm done. Um you have a transmitter, an input device, logic chip, Since we're on the topic of the technology, uh are there any like what are our options? Is this the only way that we go about it, or are there other thin Um, these these aren't technology options in that sense. a basic principles and basic components that are needed. So each component represents one function, but I think the basic functions are the logic, the transmitter	The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed various options for components and energy sources.
I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start, was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at, Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket? Yeah, that's good. I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible. Um on off, up and down channels, up and down volume and uh skip to a channel. Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do. And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features, is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some Yeah, it's as optional functions. 'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they, you know, w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that. Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls? Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories. One would be audio controls, one would be video controls, and the other one would be a device. I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets, right, where we could throw things into, and then from there decide whether it's basic, or it's non-basic. Mm okay, great. Device is basically anything which we can't categorise, right. shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed, where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of, okay, we're talking about this. Yeah, yeah I think that's definitely a good idea. so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know	The team then discussed features to include in the remote and what they could do to figure out how to categorize them.
and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching.	The marketing expert will work on trend watching
Feel like fruit.	The case will have a soft fruit-like feel to it.
I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons	The remote will have rubber buttons.
Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light? We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days. Um energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery, but have have kinetic power,	What sort of battery to use.
Um and when the corporate colour is yellow, I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour, So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion, then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize. So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here, had a sorta background yellow, and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons. And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing? and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side,	How to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, the corporate color, and soft materials into the remote.
I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape. Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand, and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need.	What shape the remote should be.
I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting. decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five, and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered, that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories, um. And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext, ignoring everything except the T_V_, and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan.	The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting.
Uh basically what I wanna do here, before we get into it uh too far, is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful. Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general, um consumers in general, the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control, a fancy look and feel, okay, and not, it specified, not a functional look or or feel, uh b f f fancy. Number two was that it be innovative. Uh and third priority uh for ease of use, is that I think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel, and not so much to the functionality of it. Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables, okay, especially in clothes and furniture. So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend, And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of, you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle, And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um softness in materials, shape, and function, so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all, uh sorta like a marketing identity. Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that, Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so.	The marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports, stressing the need for a product that has a fancy look and feel, is technologically innovative, is easy to use, and incorporates some aspect of fruit and vegetables in its design.
The fact that it talks to you, I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says, what is it, putting fashion into electronics or something, I think that'd probably scare me.	Whether the remote should have a talk-back function.
Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there, um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons, and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control. um the shape of the control, Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them. Um they're not very attractive to look at, and they're not very comfortable to hold, and they're very easily lost. Um for instance, the stand-by button isn't always red,	The interface specialist presented research on the appearance of current remotes, concluding that current remotes are generally unappealing in terms of look and usability.
also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display, where would we put that? Do we need an L_C_D_ display? It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot, I would've thought. what would we what would we achieve from it? And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings. So as you scroll through, 'cause we said we might have a jog dial, so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is. I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it,	Whether to have an LCD display on the remote.
I would say no need for a talk-back.	The remote will not have a talk-back function.
The buttons should be large. They should be easy to press, very comfortable. so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button, that's kinda confusing. Um should avoid s things like that. Um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere. any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden, Um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative, Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look. and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question. So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take Um I don't know where the slogan should go, or really what the slogan is. I think it's um, fashion into electronics. And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is.	The interface specialist presented ideas on how to remedy the unappealing aspects of current remotes in the team's design and also how to incorporate the corporate color scheme into the design.
but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow, doesn't make it freaky. S so like cur slightly transparent case, so it's yellow, like tinted yellow, but you can maybe see through it. Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse. Okay so so backlighting, that would be good. Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable, and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side,	What the case will look like.
Yeah I think the jog dial, what if it was flat and you just spun it,	The remote will have a jog dial.
Um like you said time to market was a problem, um and how many components are physically in there in cost. And the power is basically a factor of that. Um and the lower components, the power, the logic, the transmitter, and the infrared, um they affect you in terms of the size of your device, So I guess three things, um cost, um complexity, and the size. um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are. Um it said it could talk to you, but it never said anything about being able to listen. I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that. Okay so your basic components are buttons, okay and you have a wheel available, like a mouse scroll wheel, okay there's an L_C_D_ display, Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks. It can actually be flat or it can be curved, um and then the different types of materials that you can use, um I don't think you can use them in a combination, Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine, but plastic, rubber, and wood, Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use, but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing, but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one. Um and the other components are logic chips, um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips. The com how complex or how easy the logic is, it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size. Power consumption should be about the same. um and the other thing is um the power options. Um the first one is a standard battery. Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick	The industrial designer presented options for materials, components, and batteries and discussed the restrictions involved in using certain materials.
So as you scroll through, 'cause we said we might have a jog dial, so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is. Could we use like a jog dial, like a nice just sort of round, somewhere on it where you just roll it? The question is when you're rolling it, how do you wanna roll it? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it, whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way, it tends to get moved accidentally. Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot. Um it might work for volume, and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that, but not for channels right. Yeah I think the jog dial, a slide, because then you you don't have to put the hand.	Whether to include a jog dial on the remote.
and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured, so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand.	The materials used will be plastic and rubber.
We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days. Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch, like an automatic watch But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller? um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it. Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape. Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit. Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably, sort of feels right in your hand. So something quite curvy? about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much. Um and when the corporate colour is yellow, I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion, then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize. Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour, 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones, and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside, and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch. It feels a bit more comfortable, and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it. I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape. Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand, and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need. So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here	The team then discussed options for the shape and color scheme of the remote, as well as what components, batteries, and materials to use.
uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that. the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes,	Some team members will design a prototype of the remote
Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape. So something quite curvy?	The remote will be curvy.
I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape. Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand, and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need.	The remote will be shaped like a snowman.
Square buttons? Yeah	The remote will have square buttons.
So we're w w quite far over. something's gonna have to go. Um we're at sixteen point eight and	Meeting the target cost.
No. Do we have kinetic as well? And that's because of cost restraints is it? Yep.	The remote will not contain a kinetic battery.
We've got push buttons as well.	The remote will have push buttons.
The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together,	The remote will not feature an LCD display.
so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond,	The display will be on the television instead of on the remote.
answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology, but build something for twelve and a half pounds, so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual The constraints do come in very fast. it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right, gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money. Uh, reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting. If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them, that would've been a lot easier. I think the tools that they were given, the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration, I think that's the word. I mean sort of taking upon that idea, w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided, and then the work went on in isolation, the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other. well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team. I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room, and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c	The team felt that their creativity was hindered by the project budget and their inability to discuss the project outside of their meetings and that the structure of the task did not foster teamwork.
Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons,	The buttons will be normal colored.
out of forty nine with with zero being the highest. We are at uh two, seven, eight, ten, fifteen point five. So it's pretty good.	The prototype did fairly well in the evaluation.
uh well next up then, because we've done finance, is the project evaluation. Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing? Yeah, yeah it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave, and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then, you know. But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room. so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology, but build something for twelve and a half pounds, answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings, The constraints do come in very fast. it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right, gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money. and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts it it it does actually you know affect how, w whether you feel comfortable to communicate. and and the time the time given also restricts In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within. And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member, so But it's not bad leadership, it's just sort of s fairly strong, you know. I think the interactions are very structured. So you think maybe a little	The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process.
No. Do we have kinetic as well? And that's because of cost restraints is it? Yep. I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber. Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons, And now we're under budget.	In maintaining the target cost, the team had to lose a number of features which they originally wanted, such as a kinetic battery, an LCD display, and various color options.
I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning, and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan, So to sort of b bring together two things, sort of design goals and also the market research that we had, uh when we rate this, one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low, and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this, So the first one uh, stylish look and feel. I rate that pretty highly. Okay let's go with five then. Let's go with two point five then. high tech innovation. so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted, but jog-dial Yeah about three, okay. Style reflects a fruit inspired colour, design. Okay, the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour, the the yellow is more representative of the colour, so we'll go two. and um design is simple to use, simple in features. I mean I'd give that nearly a one. Um, soft and spongy, have we achieved that? We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price. Yeah I think it's about five. logo, we've got it in there, haven't we? And um it's within budget, yep.	The team then evaluated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, technological innovation, and spongy quality.
we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display, no need for talk-back, it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons, maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing, um hopefully a jog-dial, and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well. Um, there are a few changes we've made. Um, well look at the expense sheet, and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside, this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen, um just a a very very basic one, very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm Uh, apart from that, it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time. the advanced functions are still hidden from you, but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use. Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial? The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing. If you're using an advanced function right, like um c brightness, contrast, whatever, it will just say It might even be one, a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the, you know, the the symbols of the various functions. That's a number pad. Where are we gonna have the slogan? just like right inside there. Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand. So we're talking about ten centimetres. We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button. this button um, because it's red it's sort of very prominent, we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal. Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_	The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented their prototype and discussed the features the prototype contained.
We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing, and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all. for this first part here power-wise, have we got battery? We need an advanced chip I think, yep. We've got push buttons as well. Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one. The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together, It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone, underneath there's actually one button underneath, it's just that the panel itself is a single panel. or the colours, you could take away s colours for th for the buttons. No can do.	The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and had to decide which features to retain or lose in order to maintain the target cost.
The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together,	The remote will have a regular chip.
So we want double-curved?	The case will be double-curved.
my name's Adam Duguid, Ebenezer Ademesoye. I'm the Marketing Expert. Tarik Rahman. T_A_R_I_K_. Industrial Designer. Uh, Dave Cochrane. And you're going to be the User Interface,	The team members introduced themselves to each other by name and by their roles in the project.
This is the agenda for today's meeting. As you can see, w opening, acquaintance, tool training, project plan discussion, and closing. the reason we're here, we're gonna design a new remote control, The very broad overview is original, trendy, and user-friendly. We're gonna have the three kay phases, the functional, architectural, and the detailed design. Um First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec, technical functions, working design. Second seems to be conceptual components, properties, materials, and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far. Ebenezer, you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal? Here we have an elephant. Tarik, would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry? Uh, here we have a tiger. Uh Dave, if you'd like to uh have a dash. Um Um, the monkey, um. but uh cats are one of my favourite animals,	The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed why they liked the animal.
Project finance. As you can see, twelve point five Euros per unit. and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five. If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them. that was profiting,	The project manager discussed the project finances and selling prices.
do you think they should have some sort of stick on it, rather than buttons? Like uh control pads, you know of games, and that could allow n easy navigation, used as a joystick as well.	Having a joystick on the remote.
Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market? one thing I'm aware of is, th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models, Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design. And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket. with the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our Absolutely prohibitive, But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion. I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros. Would the the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the T_V_, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well, um um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television, we used to e play games using our cable, using the cable subscribed the cable providers, but our remote controls would get worn out really easily, I've seen the bar-code design before, Instead of people entering in what time things start, you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins, and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar, um keypad, for playing games. I think for gaming, you know you want you want some big buttons for up, down, left and right, shoot. Uh, you wanna be able to change angles in interactive	The team then discussed various features to consider in producing the remote such as gaming options, an LCD screen, and combining functionality so as to control multiple devices.
But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion. I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, Would the the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the T_V_, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well, um	Having a remote that controls multiple devices.
so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality, um, how the user interface might work,	The team will decide how the user interface will work
Project finance. As you can see, twelve point five Euros per unit.	The remote will cost 12.50 Euro to produce.
and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five.	The remote will sell for 25 Euro.
Mm-hmm. The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic, something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand. Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form,	The remote will feature an ergonomic design.
one thing I'm aware of is, th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes with the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our Absolutely prohibitive,	Putting an LCD screen on the remote.
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, L_C_D_,	The remote will have a small joystick.
the other option of course is that um the The clapping one. Um digital telephones, uh for example, one unit has somewhere where there's a button, of course you have to have that base unit, but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_. Something which you when you press that, it would beep to give its location away, on the remote unit. again say what, it would be a small transmitter, um watch battery type scenario I would say, So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_, and what, a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit, Light bulb as well, a small speaker you mean. th e the true fact, considering the cost of an L_E_D_, we could just incorporate it anyway.	What sort of components are necessary for the feature which allows the user to locate a misplaced remote.
do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up and down, Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote. and then, what, another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_. Should volume be important in the joystick, do you think? We could use say the left and right for changing channels we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, L_C_D_, and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons, the y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button. I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay. The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly, Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? Yeah, think so. So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_, and what, a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit, Light bulb as well, a small speaker you mean. th e the true fact, considering the cost of an L_E_D_, we could just incorporate it anyway. you could go for quite an interesting design. something that can make it stand out slightly. I should just look at um the speaker, the speaker and an L_E_D_.	The team also decided on some features to include in their product.
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, L_C_D_,	The remote will have a power button.
Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable, um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there.	The corporate image must be recognizable on the remote.
I mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation. you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them. this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid, um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable? I would say so, yes, I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now.	Having a remote which controls multiple devices.
Remote control should only be used for the T_V_. Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues.	The remote will only control televisions.
I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation. I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with, most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway and then, what, another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_.	What functions the LCD controls.
Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet.	The team will not work with teletext.
I'm responsible for working design, uh, this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control. So we have the energy source, we have the user interface, Uh the sender will push the button, the chip will respond, Do we need uh many buttons, or do we need l many light bulbs Um, the joystick is another thing, if we were gonna add that, um, there'd be more components to deal with that. you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip, You have the switch turn it on, infrared bulb, uh will contact the T_V_ do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide, or different light bulbs, Um, I dunno what we should decide on that.	The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote.
I I was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume, left and right for channels. I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up and down, Should volume be important in the joystick, do you think? We could use say the left and right for changing channels and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay.	What functions the joystick controls.
this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote. the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices I've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles. Um Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance, in this case the television set. Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice. On the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has, the remote control controls. it creates a rather user unfriendly interface. And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used. Um and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously, And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use, My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design. Um but uh the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most. something that's uh something that is more programmable, that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want. um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons, you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device	The user interface designer described the technical functions of a remote and stressed the need for a user focused design.
but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take, literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone, something where you can read an an um fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, Do you think that people will get mixed up, they'll be looking at this screen and that screen Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it	Whether to include LCD.
but I think we don't have a specific audience, like what is our target audience, I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile. Um, if we are if we were to follow that avenue, we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose. Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers, rather than the public. However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that, It's just, the way I figure it, twelve point five Euros per unit, we have to sell at least like three million or something like that, Um, if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television.	The team briefly discussed who they were aiming their product to along with the idea of marketing their product to television manufacturers.
I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about um voice activated control. However I've got a couple of worries about that. The power required, um and the ability to the cost, it seems like for uh an embedded system, this could cause us issues. Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible. however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far, but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take, literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone, something where you can read an an um fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say, volume control, changing channels I I was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume, left and right for channels. Do you think that people will get mixed up, they'll be looking at this screen and that screen Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it but we should probably try to stick to black and white. Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down. I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off, d up and down, maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined. we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control. if you	The team then discussed the option to include voice recognition, LCD, and a feature to locate a misplaced remote.
we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting. discussed the possibility of a macro facility, interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more, um mentioning of bar-code, joystick for user manipulation, um and ergonomics of the remote control as well. Um it's come to my attention the following. Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet. Remote control should only be used for the T_V_. Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues. Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable, um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there. Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required. to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing. Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so. Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first,	The project manager recapped the events of the previous meeting and briefed the team on some new requirements the team must follow when designing the remote.
Finally, my opinion. The voice recognition thing is cool. And uh voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already. It's a bit sketchy at some times, uh, you're not gonna get good always accurate results, but for a very fixed number of words, how many different words can you have for a remote control, up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven, For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. I'm pretty sure people would buy it. I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels, So if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that However, oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, there's no need to spend money on research and development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. But if we do have the voice recognition thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of. there're two options. Either you have voice recognition by itself, which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet, or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you, it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself. So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote. But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part, then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control, Um, will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote, I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control, if they have the money, but would they return it after a while	The marketing expert also presented information regarding voice recognition and what demographic finds the feature appealing.
Functional requirement by me Ebenezer. we did some research, we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls. We asked some uh open ended questions, and we asked some very specific questions, Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people, so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five, twenty five to thirty five, there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group. some the bad stuff we got, remotes are often lost. Most buttons are not used any more, like you said, teletext is outdated now. there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses. Takes too long to master the remote control. I've seen some remote controls that are big, they have a lot of buttons, you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something, Some of the good stuff we got. Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five, most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software. um most people want remote controls to be pretty, they want it to be fancy, th they they want it to be different,	The marketing expert presented research on consumer preferences and user requirements for remotes.
However, oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, So if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that I'm pretty sure people would buy it. For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. And uh voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already. The voice recognition thing is cool. but for a very fixed number of words, It's a bit sketchy at some times, uh, you're not gonna get good always accurate results, I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels, there's no need to spend money on research and development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. But if we do have the voice recognition thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of. there're two options. Either you have voice recognition by itself, which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet, or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you, it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself. So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote. But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part, then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control, Um, will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote, I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control, if they have the money, but would they return it after a while I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about um voice activated control. However I've got a couple of worries about that. The power required, um and the ability to the cost, it seems like for uh an embedded	Whether to include voice recognition as a feature on the remote.
Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? Yeah, think so.	The remote will have a beeping noise which goes off when a user is trying to locate it.
and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay?	Instead of an "okay" button, the user will push down on the joystick.
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, L_C_D_,	The remote will have LCD.
say something like um lithium ion battery,	The remote will use a lithium battery.
product evaluation, doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype. Um you're gonna look at product evaluation.	The marketing expert will work on a product evaluation
you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage looking from prototyping of some des description using clay. Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay.	The industrial designer and user interface designer will work on a prototype.
Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf, um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers if you've got a lot of channels, the number keypad can be quite annoying as well, what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components, um, say something like um lithium ion battery, Looks like we going for a double curved design. Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that. Um, looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber. Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is, we might need to have some kind of inner frame. there would be basically two points of articulation. W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip. Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation? but it could be a weak point in um the structure, do you think? If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible, spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic, if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo? Sure, yeah. Make it harder to lose, as well. The noise for when you lose the banana, um f yeah, for when you lose the remote control, it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that, rather than a standard beep beep. y you lose the banana, you press a button, and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana. I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control. Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s, you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular	The team then discussed what materials and components to use, the color of the remote, and programming options for the remote.
Programming them can be a right pain. So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers. I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control. Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s, you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to. But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option, then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing. An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer, we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes, maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ programming it to use your T_V_, you might hook it up to the P_C_. The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming I'm not sure, but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive.	Having a feature on the remote which allows the user to use a computer to program the remote according to the television model he owns.
like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button. So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on. Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used. Um.	Where to place the company slogan on the remote.
Um, looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber.	The remote will have a case made of rubber.
Looks like we going for a double curved design.	The remote will have a double curved design.
if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo? Sure, yeah.	The remote will be yellow.
We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool. And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe, Uh we found, in order of importance, people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool. As in they want it to do a lot of good s and if it does do a lot that's a bonus, but they don't care so much, Technology technical technologically innovative. People want it to be that, but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does. like the interface is really important. And easy to use, it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point. The fashion, now this is seems a bit odd to me, but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture, for clothes, for shoes. How that relates to a remote control I don't know. Spongy. If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze, you know, it's spongy, then can I skip the rest? The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material, not just normal rubber. kinda spongy material. Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative, obviously. But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future Um now the fruit and veg options, either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it. but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that, or a kiwi fruit. Few questions about a spongy remote control. I've never seen one before. if we want something strong and sturdy, I say stay with plastic or titanium, but if we go with spongy, we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want, I just don't know how	The marketing expert discussed findings from trendwatching reports, which indicated a need for products which look fancy, are technologically innovative, are easy to use, have a fruit and vegetable theme, and are spongy.
Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs, and pretty much decided to just dump them all. I wasn't very impressed by them uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today. rather than looking at other remotes, uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand. um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already. Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick, two function buttons and the L_C_D_, I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because one of the menus that we could have available um v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels, You must have two two modes, basic mode, where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels, up down for volume, um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions. Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design, um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people. That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate, then. And also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be, you know, soft to touch the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users. And you then have, at the uh at the bottom, the L_C_D_, and this would need to be articulated	The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for an ergonomic remote which conforms to the shape and movements of the human hand, as well as an option in which users could connect their remotes to computers in order to download program settings.
This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of, um, The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all, could be plastic our plastic. Uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well, or titanium or even wood. we decide what it's gonna be. Probably plastic. Uh we need the infra-red transmitter. Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it, um could be plastic w or rubber even as well. Um three different types of batteries. Um can either use a hand dynamo, or the kinetic type ones, you know that they use in watches, or else uh a solar powered one. Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power, would be my one query. Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power? And solar cells, I dunno about that. Uh. We should probably just use conventional batteries. Um, just like in usual remote controls. Um. And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have. Uh one is a flat one, and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved. but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved, the single curved and double curved, would you be able to give an example? Double curved. It probably means this is probably double curved. Uh whereas a single curved would be like that. it looks better than the single curve, but uh you can't have it in titanium, and for the buttons, um it can have the scroll wheel Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use, and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive. there's trade-offs there. Um you have to decide, if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber, then you have these rubber buttons as well. I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad	The industrial designer presented options for batteries, materials and shapes to use for the case, buttons, and chips.
I think to sum up the last meeting, would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out. Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick, L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons. Um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck, and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck.	The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting.
Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation. Um. we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction. Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them? Um people made good use of the uh pen and paper? I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be. I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh of the researchers studying this. Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves. How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today? Good. yeah I liked it, Leadership. As much as can be leadered in this uh thing. Very good. Um last one we've got is room for creativity. Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along, We're burs bursting with creativity. We we're not lacking in ideas, I think of in the end, ideas that can be used sadly. Not so much that we weren't full of ideas, but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing. I think we needed a larger budget. Mm. I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh I I think it's gone okay today, considering the information that we've had at our disposal, and um such. Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more Yeah, to begin with. It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive. is there anything else that anybody would like to to add, um before I quickly write up a final report. but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell. I was	The team then evaluated the project process, finding that they were happy overall but quite displeased with the small budget.
we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So five, seven, ten, sixteen, twenty one. Which gives us an average of three. it's it's not bad. considering the price we had to get this in, to have a positive you know, even based on the four of us being heavily biased, um are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good?	Overall, the prototype received average marks.
we've got the use of the L_C_D_. I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display	The remote will feature an LCD.
As for the um as for the single curve, um well this edge and this edge, like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it, because it's gonna be flat on one side, I've said single curved. so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation.	The case for the remote will be single curved.
just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one, um Um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end, Uh many of our components are gonna be standard, off the shelf, but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display. Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber, most likely gonna be double curved, etcetera. due to your hard work, we might as well let the uh two designers go first, and uh show us the prototype. Quite how the best way to do this is, I'm not sure, I think if we both step up and uh outline our ideas. do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design. Um for one thing, it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_. As it turned out, the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick, You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round, But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand, the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful, so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design. this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing. Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle, having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form, and a bit more ergonomic as well. I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down. As for the um as for the single curve, um well this edge and this edge, like I say it would	The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented a prototype for the remote the team is designing and discussed its ergonomic appearance and its features.
this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing. is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost,	The remote will be made of plastic instead of rubber.
l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and we can make it yellow,	The remote will be designed in a special color.
Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs we've got point two of a Euro left over there. Even then as well, um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate. It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now. Um. We've got an advanced chip, we've got the use of the L_C_D_. I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place. Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um? You now have as much information as I do. Um. I've said single curved. We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost, if I've read this thing correctly, then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button. As you can see, the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the	The original specifications of the team's product proved to be too expensive and so the team had to discuss which features to lose and which to maintain in order to meet the target cost.
Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by. it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process. seven scale. after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria, we average that And uh the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies, marketing strategies, and also those I put together from the user requirements phase. those are the criteria. And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better, but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned, which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points. we have to go through each point. and just give it a a score. uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost, or to be able to find them once they are lost. I mean, uh is the homing thing still the locator, is that still Yeah, that's still part of the design. I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost, Mm. And making it a bright colour helps we still have that noise thing, on a scale of one to seven, how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost? I'd say number one. just before we go through all of the steps here, um well what we'll do is um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate, and then we'll come back to the product evaluation is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion, and clothing fashion. Something I neglected from my initial research That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this. And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface, And we can come back to it, you said. Slight problem we	The marketing expert began to lead the team in conducting an evaluation of the prototype but was interrupted when the project manager shifted the discussion to examining the production costs of the team's product.
Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost. Three. I think we can do three. Reduce the number of unused buttons. I'd say we're doing well there. Easy to use interface, buttons menu, menus we're not doing so badly. Um easy to use let's forget that one. Fancy looking. It doesn't get much fancier. Technologically innovative. we're getting rid of the locator thing Mm. I'd give it a three for this for that. I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote, Materials that people find pleasing. Sponginess is what they really would have wanted, apparently. Plastic, it sucks. Mm-hmm. I'd s I I'd give it a six, to be honest. that's totally thrown everything off balance. Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion. I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours. Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype Leopard print would be cool. But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg, It would also help keep the the product placement Is this like a banana type colour? it's not shaped like a banana is I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie. Um. I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg, Mm. I'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion. Is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions. and we can make it yellow, and that's pretty much banana like. Yeah, I'll go with five.	The prototype was evaluated on the basis of its ability to be located when misplaced, ease of use, appearance, technological innovativeness, and sponginess.
we'll come back to uh your evaluation Just to give you an idea, um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well,	After discussing costs, the team returned to conducting their product evaluation.
Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, we've got the use of the L_C_D_. Mm. I think if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings If we remove the L_C_ display, we could save ourselves I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display	Whether to keep the LCD.
was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_, which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure we've got point two of a Euro left over there. Even then as well, um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate. It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now. Um. I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, if I've read this thing correctly, then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button. Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost, this one comes in under price as you can see, uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that? Have we factored that in? Uh no, we haven't, not That's too expensive If we remove the L_C_ display, we could save ourselves I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean keep the um the articulation? Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved, it can still be single curved,	Meeting the target cost.
Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved, it can still be single curved, Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation.	Whether to have a double curved or single curved case.
Okay, um, first is the functional design, um this is where we all go off and do our individual work, um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, Um, conceptual design, and then the detailed design, how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work.	She presented a long-range agenda for the whole project.
We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board, and um sum up the characteristics of that animal. I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger. Uh, maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make? A kind of dog? Okay, now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be Yeah, it can be a crocodile, it can be a crocodile. it's meant to be an eagle	The group introduced themselves to each other and practiced with the meeting room tools by drawing on the board.
Yeah, I don't I don't know how for twenty fi, or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get, you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway, I'd assume. The other thing is, just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again, it could have a flip top remote control I think that's a cost thing,	There may not be enough money in the budget to allow the addition of all the features the group discussed, such as the LCD display.
Um I'm Sarah, the Project Manager Okay, this is our agenda, um get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other. Um then we'll go do tool training, talk about the project plan, discuss our own ideas and everything um Now, we're developing a remote control which you probably already know. Um, we want it to be original, um, trendy, appealing to a wide market, and user-friendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches should be able to use it.	The Project Manager gave an introduction to the goal of the project, to create a trendy yet user-friendly remote.
but you know on a mobile phone, you can press a key and it gives you a menu, it's got a menu display, I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful, so you've got a little L_C_D_ display. instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user, may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that, What about the older generation? that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps, I don't like the, you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system. I find it really confusing, Yeah, I don't I don't know how for twenty fi, or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get, you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway, I'd assume.	They discussed grouping features into a menu and adding an LCD display.
And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone, it can still be lightweight plastic, you know? Something that's easily moulded and produced. about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable? I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics, I mean you don't you you can still have plastic we don't have to use metal, and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic, I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything. They're kind of moulded so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about.	They also discussed the look of various materials that may be used in the design, in keeping with the company's goal to create fashionable electronics.
Um finance-wise, we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros, which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds, at all. Seventeen. Okay, that's expensive. Havi having said that though, if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway. um production cost's at twelve fifty, so Um, and profit aim is fifty million Euros, You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups	The Project Manager presented the project budget, the projected price point, and the projected profit aim for the project.
What are your experiences with remote controls? I mean I've got we got um we had three videos, a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls, um that you programme each of your things into, but that kept losing the signals but that was quite good, the fact that you could You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you. My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy, not doing any tampering with it and programming, I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do And symbols that you don't necessarily understand, So simplification of symbols you could think of. and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording, things like that inside it. The other thing is, just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again, it could have a flip top remote control	Then the group began a discussion about their own experiences with remote controls to generate initial design ideas for making the product user-friendly.
so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things. Um and then we'll come back and liaise again Okay, um, first is the functional design, um this is where we all go off and do our individual work, um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, um what effects the product has to have	The group will prepare for the functional design meeting to discuss the components and functions of the product.
Um, th the shape you got trendy. I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical, What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back. so they came up with something like this, curled up, so here, so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing, curled up like a boat. I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth. I mean for example, if it was a C_ or something like that, you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something, you know even though we're using plastic, you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic, You could have different kind of casings. So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament Yeah maybe we could come at some say five, six des designs	The group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers.
but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me, to produce our own mobile phones, that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features, um, chain companies like Carphone Warehouse, you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it, Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, th you know, which button is it I press for this? Th as free as a free aspect of our service, would that not make it more attractive to them? But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that. Instruction manuals. there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street, but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that. But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible	A customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly, but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget.
Okay, so the remote control functions. Um we've got the T_V_, we've got the video, now there's um I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of programme details, Video plus. We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that, And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that, I've not come across that function if you look in the newspaper, T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five, six digit number afterwards I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now, Um, what other functions? oh batteries, that's what I was thinking about. Mobile phone batteries, what kinda battery is that? th the thing that you get with mobile house phones, you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something, Um, something like that should reduce the size of it. yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? Rechargeable with a docking station. And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something, a beeping for being lost, um.	They discussed the functions the remote will have, including Video Plus capability and rechargeable batteries.
further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is, it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market. I'm thinking kind of Japan, I'm thinking uh young, um office people,	The group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market.
we have new project requirements, um we're not going to be using teletext, our control is only going to be for T_V_, it's not going to be a combined control, I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it, but I don't know, what do you think? Would that imply video use? But I mean, general T_V_ controls do do video as well. I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming. Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset. Um so we want logo, we want um fashionable, trendy,	The Project Manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function, that it be used only to control television, and that it include the company image in its design.
I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view we used our our usability lab, the company's usability lab, we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public, all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab, Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarised some of them here. The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls, Um, we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy, but um that's quite a high proportion of our our, you know, international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking. Um, current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall. For example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot, Um, fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier, uh remote controls are often lost in the room, fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that. Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use Um, um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury. Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition, again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition. Something we didn't put to them, but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now	The Marketing Expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device, and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology.
Mm, and the rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable with a docking station. So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? You could have different kind of casings. So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that.	The remote will be bundled with a docking station to recharge the remote's batteries and a user-friendly instruction manual, and multiple casings will be made available.
Yeah. Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention, but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting, just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use, rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever. So what the concept is to have a flip-top model. The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever, can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top. and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly. if you ask me personally, I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that. and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard	The User Interface Designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface.
Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves, so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is	The limitations of the budget will restrict the development of some features; several of the features that the group wanted to include may have to be made simpler to decrease cost.
Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use, wireless Um, most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now our one, I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control. You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it? if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries, the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not, right? well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones Um, now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um which would basically, when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver, which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base, because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side	He presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design.
Okay this is uh the working design, What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design? Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state, whether that be the power, or the channel um or the volume, everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to. Um, so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we wanna make sure that our design stands out	The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote.
and the I the instruction manual, I don't know if we deal with that, um. What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting?	The Marketing Expert will research consumers' opinions on instruction manuals.
I think we have to design one product Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same, yes, absolutely.	It was decided that the group will produce one product design instead of creating alternate designs in an attempt to accomodate different users' preferences.
I'm thinking uh young, um office people, I'm thinking kind of Japan,	The marketing will be focused towards a young, business-class buyer.
I mean for example, if it was a C_ or something like that, you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something, I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea, um something about Videoplus. Video plus.	The remote will feature Video Plus capabilities and a seashell-like shape to accomodate the LCD display and the flip screen.
I'm not sure how long we've got left, but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed. Do we agree on the battery? The kinetic. so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it. Um, that means that there's no function for li the port, I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, The L_C_D_'s not cheap. Maybe we could start with the black and white. The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it? did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries? the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch. Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one, on the buttons, On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones, Um, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. For the body design I think plastic, so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed, um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it um psychedelic, This would definitely be different enough, I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more you could have um a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little And incorporating the company logo? 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report, it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere, they do want it to be obvious that it's our product I think you just address that with um advertising. Obviously it'll	The Project Manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design.
Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, So it could be like, where is the remote, and the remote answers I am here.	He announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider, depending on price.
so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it. I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle. Yeah, depending on the expense of it. have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then?	Speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly.
Do we agree on the battery? The kinetic. Um, that means that there's no function for li the port, The L_C_D_'s not cheap. Maybe we could start with the black and white. the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch. did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries? Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one, on the buttons, On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones, Um, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. For the body design I think plastic, so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed, um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it um psychedelic, This would definitely be different enough, you could have um a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little	It was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery, that the remote will feature an LCD screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons, and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available.
Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals, based on your input Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options. There's um actually no rechargeable option available, I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment, dynamo charging, I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest, So you wind up your remote control before you use it. like the the solar charging, 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_. I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun. But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway. The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up, it like it runs for long time? well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out. referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with um standard batteries? Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical. Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest W w which one would last the longest, because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every	The Industrial Designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available.
and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching. Um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel, rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls. They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative, and of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important, is twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there, that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials,	The Marketing Expert made a presentation on trend watching, including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion.
we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top we just took the input from the previous meeting, especially from the marketing and industrial design, to check on the customer needs and feasibility. the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here. So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here. And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here. basically which is what we d do in computer, have icons or touch pad or whatever, so f on the s simpler board, on the top we have this button, rubber buttons, to keep frequently changing the channels. Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part? So the findings are too many cluttered buttons. Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained, Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, So it could be like, where is the remote, and the remote answers I am here. so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit, but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, uh red chilli uh I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern, here, so we we we would not change h that particular pattern	The User Interface Designer presented his main interface design, which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the LCD screen for other functions, to keep frequently used features easy to use.
The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up, 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research, But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe. there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing so perhaps uh some something made of rubber,	He suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials.
'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. There's um actually no rechargeable option available,	Several of the features that the group had wanted to integrate into the design were either too costly or unavailable due to new limitations from the factory.
Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext, it wasn't gonna be a control for everything 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. There's um actually no rechargeable option available,	The group had to change many of the original design elements to an alternative.
the minutes from the last time. Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext, it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow. we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition, we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal. We were thinking a shell, but something along those lines, and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost,	The Project Manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting.
The kinetic. so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it. I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one, on the buttons, On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones, Um, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, you could have um a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle.	It was decided that the remote would feature an LCD screen, rubber buttons, colorful rubber changeable skins, a kinetic battery, and possibly speech recognition if it is still within the budget to include it.
Prototype presentation. Me and William worked on a prototype, and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that. I can hold it like and I'll I'll show you the presentation. And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there. Um It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour, either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something. This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say, it's yeah yeah, it would be sort of inset into the into the top The black and white touch screen and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat. we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually, thinking about it now, could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well, So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections, Um we decided that um the voice recognition system, it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. So you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where where is the remote and it'll shout back, I'm here, or something. Um the standard, there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about. obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers, it would need two separate P_C_B_s, so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling. And uh because, obviously, all T_V_s use this, the same infrared medium, we'd just be using using the	The Industrial Designer presented the prototype and discussed its look, its internal components, and its interface.
um we decided to use a kinetic charger, standard chip, um 'cause it can come in various different sizes, We wanted a stand-by function. The case material is gonna be soft, rubbery, changeable. Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design. Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit, keeping with the hip kind of feel. Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that. Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_.	The Project Manager went over decisions from the previous meeting.
but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. If you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five. We could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version. I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product. We can put in our recommendations. If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. Um as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers So if we take voice recognition out That'll do it. Twelve point three five. we are close to the budget. Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty? So we are under the budget.	The group decided to remove speech recognition but to propose to the management that it  remain in the design.
I've got finance here now. We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value. So are we still on for kinetic? Yeah. See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. Um it might have influenced our choice. It was a regular chip on print you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells, there should just be one. one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker. One double curve. 'cause it's two. what's a single curve then? It would just be a flat bottom with one curve. like a domed thing. Um we've got plastic and rubber, I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, See, it says case material. we're not actually using plastic in the case, There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing. So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there? Or sh we should just put it in as one, because the plastic is zero anyway. special colour, do we need that? Might do, if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours. the push-button's one and L_C_ display one. I think we could change the battery also. Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery. and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing, is that going to make a difference? so the highest we've got is the electronics here. Um and the interface. If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference? it um it would make one difference. What I feel is, customers never said anything about the battery. but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. If you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five. If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three.	The Project Manager presented the final cost of the device which exceeded the initial projected price point.
Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modifications? I don't think so. We happy to go ahead? I think we yeah. I think we're set. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, I'll just leave it there. and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that.	The group then decided that enough of this criteria had been satisfied for the project to continue.
Um I've now got evaluation criteria. This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research. the collection of the criteria, as we saw in our previous meeting, was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company. are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting, The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use, it should incorporate current fashion trends, and those the two main ones, they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours. The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, We're going to use a seven point scale, where one is true and seven is false. and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here. Is it everybody is going to evaluate, or just the Market w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven. I won't write all of that out again. It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, Actually, it might be an idea, if we each did give our own individual rating, and we could take an average at the end. So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques, and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's who. Criteria A_, the fancy look and feel. My own rating for that would be a two. Two and three quarters? criteria B_, criterion B_, technologically innovative. I would give that a three. I'd give it a one. It's just two point five for that one. ease of use. Based on what you've said there, I	The Marketing Expert evaluated the product according to the initial product goals.
We could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version. I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product. We can put in our recommendations. If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. Um as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers So if we take voice recognition out That'll do it. Twelve point three five.	It was removed when the project exceeded its initial budget, but it will be suggested to the management that the speech recognition should remain in the product design.
Um we decided that um the voice recognition system, it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. So you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where where is the remote and it'll shout back, I'm here, or something. though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, Yeah, it was it was uh a voice voice recognition, And are we happy with the costs on that? That is going to be feasible, cost-wise. Yeah, yeah, that yeah, that's feasible.	It was decided that the speech recognition component seemed feasible, so it was added to the prototype design to provide a device locator function.
There's a final questionnaire. we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with,	All members will fill out a final evaluation questionnaire.
If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. with recommendations that they the budget be increased,	The group will suggest to the management that speech recognition remain in the product design.
We happy to go ahead? I think we yeah. I think we're set. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that.	The group decided that the device fulfilled enough of the project's initial goals to continue in production.
And now we've we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top.	The company logo will appear on the inside of the device when opened.
The black and white touch screen The top screen, as we said, is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen	The LCD screen will appear only in black and white.
It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour, either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something. This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, um which there'd be sort of a wide choice	The plastic case will be a neutral color, and the changeable rubber cases will be available in vibrant, fruit colors.
I think it's really good that this has been very market research based, because just going back to mobile phones, I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really, you know, say is is obvious and visible. We see it in mobile phones a lot, and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from. There are innovations in that that people don't really want. and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based.	The Marketing Expert felt that the market-research based approach would help the project's success with consumers.
I think we had a nice time. Although we had our separate tasks, there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to um bounce off each other. in that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take and adjust our remit where necessary. Yeah, I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody. We came to a very predic creative design, yeah. And Sarah, you coordinated the work very well. although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good. I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would've come out a d little different, I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like shot down, you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model.	All members felt that they interacted well and that they felt they could be creative.
Product evaluation. We've done room for creativity, Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make. Um I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork. Although we had our separate tasks, I think we had a nice time. there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to um bounce off each other. in that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take and adjust our remit where necessary. Yeah, I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody. We came to a very predic creative design, yeah. And Sarah, you coordinated the work very well. although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good. I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would've come out a d little different, I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like shot down, you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model.	The group then discussed their effectiveness as a team.
Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire. There's a final questionnaire. we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with,	The Project Manager instructed the group to fill out a final evaluation questionnaire.
Um it might have influenced our choice. See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. with recommendations that they the budget be increased,	The group did not know how much the features made available to them actually cost until the prototype was constructed; their prototype design may have been different had this information been available at the beginning.
Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased, Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing? And the heating for the building, do you think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out? I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone. I think we've done very well to get within budget	The group did express, however, that the budget was overly constraining.
See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. Um it might have influenced our choice. with recommendations that they the budget be increased,	There was a lack of cost information at the beginning of the project.
I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things Yeah the universal ones. Yeah. So presumably that might be an idea to put into. so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle,	They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function.
So presumably that might be an idea to put into. so maybe we could think about colour? so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, What do we think a good size would be for this?	The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design.
So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said? Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.	The User Interface Designer will research possible shapes and colors for the device.
So you do the looking around at other remote controls.	The Marketing Expert will examine the features and design of competitors' remotes.
So you do the looking around at other remote controls. and you could look into um basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever. So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said? Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.	The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.
so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, What do we think a good size would be for this? Kind of um, maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of, just hand held,	They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface.
and you could look into um basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.	The Industrial Designer will research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.
and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others. And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote, there could be a little microphone on it, and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort. But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you. and then as for the user interface it should be trendy, right, so more low tech and not too many buttons. So I think I I missed the budget thing, it was fifty million Euros? so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time. Well I guess more realistically then, we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing, An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries cheap plastic uh, you know, Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea? Yeah, yeah, we could do that too. Or a little base station or something,. uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons, but since we're a cutting edge company, we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition, whistling recognition and rocket power Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh, just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about. Um so here's you know, a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me. uh personal preferences, I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory, just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's	The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on important internal components that would keep the project within its budget, and discussed possible materials and programmable features.
uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user I want to point out that our motto, put the fashion in electronics, the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set. but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones. These are two leading um remote controls at the moment. I mean this one's got loads of buttons, Um, personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use, it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff, Um, well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important, um And um I thought not too edgy and like a box, so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks. was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people, like glow-in-the-dark Easy finder with the a whistle function or something, or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries. and uh I was just curious to know, have we done any research into how many people can whistle? is that a function we want in the remote? you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just, you know, where are you?. Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um, shouting, you know, uh and then, what would the response be? It beeps back at you or something?	The User Interface Designer presented several competitors' remotes and discussed the features that would make their own device more user-friendly.
Okay, so, we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have. speech recognition potentially, flat screen interface, L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display, interactive display. Um glow in the dark, is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material? But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control, I know of no products um that use speech recognition well. but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep. You just say you know, um whatever you whatever you want the remote for, you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know, within hearing range. I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing. we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially, and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well, of the glow in the dark material, just as gimmickyness. there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged. So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have. Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_, it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits. so we'll go with speech recognition, yeah? Um, speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design. Glow in dark. if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick. And also, integrating the, remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan. What I thought as well about the material is um	The group discussed the features they would like to incorporate into the design in light of the new requirements and budget constraints.
Right, also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting, We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated, and everybody uses the internet anyway. Um it's only for the television, and um instead of colours and sorta colour options, they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design. Um, everything, all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow. And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh	The Project Manager gave several new requirements for the project to the group.
And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the We put the fashion in electronics	The Program Manager said that he would ask to what extent the company motto had to be incorporated into the design.
we also want to limit the number of buttons Um glow in the dark, is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material? we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially, and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well, of the glow in the dark material, just as gimmickyness. So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have. so we'll go with speech recognition, yeah? Um, speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design. Glow in dark. if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick. And also, integrating the, remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan.	They decided to keep speech recognition as one of their components, and decided to include some programmable features, limit the number of button functions, and make the remote yellow and glow-in-the-dark, in an organic shape.
Uh, yes, I have to look at the uh market potential for this product, Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey. Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly. uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design, uh should be appropriate, should be good looking for the consumers. Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also. but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated. Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons, If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not, we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point, like for speech recognition in a remote control. because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five, They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control.	The Marketing Expert presented requirements of users as found in a company market study.
and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well, of the glow in the dark material, just as gimmickyness. Um, speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design. Glow in dark. if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick.	The remote will have an organic shape and feature some yellow coloring and glow-in-the-dark material.
now, it was function F_ eight. f oh sorry F_ eight. and if you just click that it'll go ahead, one at a time. Oh you wanna go back? Just escape. Yeah. No signal. Computer adjusting, yeah. Um, F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing. Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing. So I plug it in, press F_ five?	The group seemed to have some minor technical difficulties when opening their presentations.
If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not, we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point, like for speech recognition in a remote control. because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five,	He presented the age groups polled and said that the target marketing group should be users aged fifteen to thirty-five.
So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have. so we'll go with speech recognition, yeah? Um, speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design.	The remote will feature speech recognition and programmable channel and volume preferences.
uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design, uh should be appropriate, should be good looking for the consumers. Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also. but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated. Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons, They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control.	The study showed that users want a fancier-looking but uncomplicated remote control, and are interested in speech recognition.
we also want to limit the number of buttons Um, speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design.	The number of button functions will be limited to make the remote user-friendly.
I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea. having a rechargeable stand, so that not only it doubles as a stand, but um for using it as uh recharging it, but also for using it as sound recognition.	The remote will be powered by rechargeable batteries and come with a recharging stand.
'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition, Uh speech recognition, I think,	The remote will feature speech recognition.
but something ergonomically shaped and organic, like good to hold, based on fruits and natural things like that, because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow, you know. So again I mean like we could have, uh I mean, we could quite easily have the the main body be a different I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour, So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing.	The remote will be yellow or partially yellow and have an organic shape.
Okay, like we could have a big banana shaped remote control, Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip. Yeah. How would you point it? We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end. y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea. it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe. I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape. So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable Like a gourd almost, or a squash of some sort? you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape, Or we can do something, we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey, let the public choose what they want. There's a good man. There's a good idea. Yeah, what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition? do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit? l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh, I dunno, an apple. we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes, different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece.	The group discussed colors and shapes further, and decided that the remote will be yellow, and perhaps having a fruit-inspired shape.
Or we can do something, we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey, let the public choose what they want. There's a good man. There's a good idea.	Several shapes will be designed and shown to the public so that the most popular shape is chosen.
So multi-coloured buttons. or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish, perhaps. Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well. I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use, Like uh an hour glass kind of figure, uh I could put the microphone here. So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or button will be on the upper side, buttons will be the on the upper side.	He discussed the color and shape of the remote with the group and the placement of the components on the device.
Well, I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it, And that would k also give it kinda durability and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast. so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath? I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think, w like, 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours	The group decided to use a rubber or latex material to give the device a spongy feel.
Um you open it up, there's a circuit board inside, and there's a a chip, a processor, the T_A_ one one eight three five, which um receives input from the buttons,	He gave a layout of the placement of the components in the device.
I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among, and I'll I'll give you the uh, I guess, technical considerations for those. And I'm gonna use the whiteboard, just 'cause we haven't used it. the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls, see how they work, and then we'll throw in our new innovations um Um you open it up, there's a circuit board inside, and there's a a chip, a processor, the T_A_ one one eight three five, which um receives input from the buttons, Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier, which is made of some transistors and amplifiers, op-amps, and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light, Um. So you know, as we said, we got the outer casing, which we have to decide, you know, what's it gonna be, processor, um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had, Um so for the casing, uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh, you know, we have a bunch of options from wood, titanium, rubber, plastic, whatnot, um latex, double-curved, curved.	The Industrial Designer went over all of the internal components and materials that will be incorporated in the design.
or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish, perhaps. Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well. y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea. it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe. I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape. So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable Like a gourd almost, or a squash of some sort? you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape, do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit? l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh, I dunno, an apple. Well, I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing, and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick, but something ergonomically shaped and organic, like good to hold, based on fruits and natural things like that, So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing. So again I mean like we could have, uh I mean, we could quite easily have the the main body be a different because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow, you know. I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour,	The group had difficulty deciding how to incorporate the company's yellow color and the fruit and vegetable trend into the prototype design without the remote seeming overly gimmicky or childish.
so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath? I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think, s I guess we decided on material, So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel,	The remote will feature a rubber or latex casing.
and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay.	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will build a prototype out of clay for the next meeting.
uh our next meeting's in half an hour and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay. Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches.	The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype.
I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea. having a rechargeable stand, so that not only it doubles as a stand, but um for using it as uh recharging it, but also for using it as sound recognition.	The group decided to use a rechargeable battery and recharging stand.
There's um an L_C_D_ thing, I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us. and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in. I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good. you program it like you say, record, um and then, play, and then, record, play machine, and stuff like that, the L_C_D_, it does look smart, but I think maybe for our budget, 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition, But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more, It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty, you know. I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost,. Although, th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now, And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use, so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_. It's a it's great, it's a good idea, but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use, it's not the thing we should go for, I think. we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape, I think. Well, si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours, I think your lemon wasn't that far s I like I like the colourful buttons as well. I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff.	She discussed using voice recognition, an LCD screen, and color to make the device easier to use and to improve its look.
okay, so the interface concept um. Um so the method, we looked at existing designs, Okay, so most remote controls use graphical interface, Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout, which makes it confusing. but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you. This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse, Um and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that, But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side. But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen. Again that's just quite boring shape, grey, looks quite space-agey, but too many buttons, I think on that one. Um this one I thought was really cool. It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about. and it's quite an organic shape Yeah, I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um, I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing. So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever. And this one, the over-sized one, I don't know about you, but I think it's a bit too gimmicky. I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything, the raised symbols I thought were good, And the mouse one, I thought it was a good idea, Child-friendly, I thought this was good,	The User Interface Designer compared the designs of several competitors' remotes to decide which features should be used in their own design.
When we did uh f fashions uh, recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes, shoes, and everything with fruits and vegetables, the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look, hard look. Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff? The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co	He discussed trends in fashion that should be incorporated into the prototype design.
Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching, We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey, but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market, when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good, rather than having a functional look and feel uh good. The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative. And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use, and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language, something.	The Marketing Expert presented the results of a market survey that indicated users' most important preferences in remote control features.
So we could even add something. Ah yeah, we could add things. Yeah, if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money, if we don't have to.	It was decided that another feature could possibly be added.
Uh room for creativity, were we happy with that? W I think we were very creative. Leadership, Great leadership. Uh teamwork. I thought went well. Yeah, everyone got enough input, I think. These pens are are neat though. Yeah, these are new ideas, like glow-in-the-dark or something like that. So just general thumbs up for all of us then.	The group evaluated their effectiveness as a team and felt that all members worked well together and could be creative, and that the project had very good leadership.
So now is the final evaluation, final evaluation of the uh uh of our product. whether it meets our standards or not. w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything. We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements, whether it meets the user requirements or not, this product. Then trends, whether it is as fashion trends or not? Then marketing strategy of the company. Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale. what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not? It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted. Seven is good, yeah, isn't it? True or false? Uh one is means highest ranking, So it's one for from your point of view. I'm gonna give it a two. Oh, I'll go for a one. Uh for me personally it is everything fine, but there is one thing which limits the customers, like we are having only two, three designs, But if a person doesn't like banana, or orange, you are limiting him. So we are showing our preference for particular fruits, Is that no is that not trends? because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits, they give a range of products, a range of shapes, But in electronics, I think, it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates. we are doing a very wrong thing. We're gonna average them? I have taken it very wrongly. About one point f one point eight. Well um going on uh the specifications that we had, that fruit and vegetables are quite popular, and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons, I would give it um, so I would actually give it a three. 'Kay. As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology, um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the	The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product.
Um one's based on the banana, one's based on the tomato so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one, or as mm few buttons as possible, mainly speak recognition.	The remote will come in several designs: two will have different fruit or vegetable shapes, one of which will feature speech recognition in lieu of a large number of buttons.
Um one's based on the banana, one's based on the tomato so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one, or as mm few buttons as possible, mainly speak recognition. If you do need buttons, you can flip it over, and there's some there,	Two prototypes featured different fruit shapes, with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons.
These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down.	It also featured scroll wheels for channel control.
and and um we have the banana-based one too. This one is uh, I suppose for the younger audiences.	The other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind.
Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance. Uh, let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria. the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons, uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros. So basically, um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape, but just have it flattened. Doesn't save us quite as much. W why is the uh double curved two of them? Oh, good point. I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half, and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward. and why why I've got it two, I don't know, But you think it should be one. Um okay, so that would take away three, which would give us Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty.	The Project Manager announced to the group that with all of their desired features, the project would go over the alotted budget; after a reanalysis of the features of the prototype, the project came in under the budget instead.
So we can launch it. Yeah. 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget.	It was decided that the product had met enough of the initial project goals to be launched on the market.
we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex, new material that we've got.	The devices were made with a latex product with a rubbery texture.
it might be trendy to some, but I'm just not swallowing the fruit, But if a person doesn't like banana, or orange, you are limiting him. like we are having only two, three designs, Uh for me personally it is everything fine, well, because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at, that that looks cool, you know,	Some felt that the banana shape would not appeal to enough of the market and that there was not enough variety in shape in the remotes to make up for this problem.
Um Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news? We made three for you. Um one's based on the banana, one's based on the tomato or as mm few buttons as possible, so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one, mainly speak recognition. If you do need buttons, you can flip it over, and there's some there, Well I like the feel of it, I like the feel of it. but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand. Um the black on the back is the slogan. but also we're gonna have the company name on the front, which is the little black kind of line in the middle. These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down. it does actually feel quite ergonomic, It would have to be a bit bigger. Um, obviously I don't think that's real sized. Um that's a speaker at the top, Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom. And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one. and and um we have the banana-based one too. This one is uh, I suppose for the younger audiences. So are there any um improvements or issues or	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototypes to the group.
and and um we have the banana-based one too. This one is uh, I suppose for the younger audiences.	There will also be a child-friendly banana-shaped remote.
but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand.	The remotes will be bundled with a yellow charging stand.
Um the black on the back is the slogan. but also we're gonna have the company name on the front, which is the little black kind of line in the middle.	Both the company name and slogan will appear on the remote.
Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones, because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems A big learning curve, yeah.	Although this is an original idea, one group member points out that may be too innovative and users could have difficulty learning how to operate it.
so we need to wrap it up now,	They did not yet come to a decision about whether this idea should be implemented.
So, this is uh first meeting of this design project. Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting, is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly, this is the the plan for today's meeting Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more. Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings, um specifically the whiteboard over there. Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um come up with some preliminary ideas about it. So we've got twenty five minutes to do that,	The project manager opens the meeting by going over the agenda.
What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television. Um we want it to be something original, something trendy and also something user friendly, so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product.	She explains the project, which is to create a new remote control for television that should be original, trendy, and user-friendly.
but im basically you're looking at the working design,	The interface specialist will look at the working design.
you're looking at the technical functions design,	The industrial designer will work on the technical functions design.
you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace,	They will get specific instructions when they get back to their workspace.
so we need to wrap it up now, Um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes, you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace, Uh I'll see you in half an hour.	They end the meeting with the project manager going over the task each member is to complete before the next meeting.
and for you it's the user requirements specification,	The marketing expert will work on user requirements specification.
Okay, so this is the um overall budget for our project. Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each. Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros. And that's selling them on the international market, not just in the U_K_. Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target. Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control? I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones. but if we all have a think, when we go away from the meeting, what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary. I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy, user friendly and original that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this. although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway, battery life, but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life, I mean we can think about all these little things,	After they talk about their overall budget, they discuss what special features they want to include in this remote control that existing ones do not have.
And that's selling them on the international market, not just in the U_K_.	The remotes will target the international market.
So I'm kind of thinking, you know like those phones that they have, the new generation ones, where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that. So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing, or like I mean you know, theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_, right? Something that's a little less crowded than this, But what do most people do? They turn it on, they watch certain specified channels, you know, and then they turn it off again. There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time, It could be one button for a menu or something, if you really need to go and do that. and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons, which just confuse them. because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones, A big learning curve, yeah.	They discuss making a menu-based remote which would be less crowded with buttons and therefore stylish and sleek but functional.
So I'm kind of thinking, you know like those phones that they have, the new generation ones, where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that. So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing, or Something that's a little less crowded than this, It could be one button for a menu or something, if you really need to go and do that.	The group got the idea of making a menu-based remote that would require very few buttons to operate.
The method that we're going to use to complete the project, that has three components as such. There's the functional design of the the remote control. the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that. Um similarly with the conceptual design, Um and then the detailed design will come after that. We'll pull it all together. I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design? Uh i is it just uh more detail, uh as I understand it? I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing. it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product? Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then	The three components of completing the project will be functional, conceptual, and detailed design.
Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each.	They will sell the remotes for twenty five Euros each.
Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project, each person in turn, I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard, and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name, what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project. So, my name's Cat Um this is a rabbit. I am the Marketing Expert I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design, um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design Um so my name is Maarika. I'm the Interface Designer in this project but I do like dogs. um so um in the different um stages of the design, so at first I will be responsible for um for yeah, designing the technical functions of the um um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept um my name is Gaurav. my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer, so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design, I'm Jen. It's a gecko. and I'm your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way, so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product.	They introduce themselves by going up to the white board and stating their name, role, drawing their favorite animal, and sharing their favorite characteristic about the animal.
Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros.	They will aim for a profit of fifty million Euros.
You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept,	The interface specialist will look at the user interface concept.
What we have to do now is to go back to our little places, complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation, Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes, w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary.	When they return to their desks they will complete a questionaire, do a summary, and send the project manager their powerpoint presentations.
but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition. Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs? but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about, With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five, tha that should be relatively simple. y you'd maybe need a code word. but like so you'd just say remote five, you know, remote ten, remote one two nine. but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check. w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet, because people are just so used to buttons What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control. If we can do with away with that, our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say, I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five. So that if that was in the the voice recognition, that would be great. It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime, you can yell at it and it'll just change it, you can look for it later, yeah. Yeah but m but on the other hand, remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control No, but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us, a and uh not to yell at it from the distance. So uh wh another	After they talk about features they might include, the project manager closes the meeting by allocating tasks.
but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_, you know, tends to be people talking Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about, and um, you know, how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_. but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition. Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs? but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about, With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five, tha that should be relatively simple. y you'd maybe need a code word. but like so you'd just say remote five, you know, remote ten, remote one two nine. but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check. w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet, because people are just so used to buttons So that if that was in the the voice recognition, that would be great. It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime, you can yell at it and it'll just change it, you can look for it later, yeah. Yeah but m but on the other hand, remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control No, but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us, a and uh not to yell at it from the distance. But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds	The group is interested in voice recognition- this is an option they will have to explore further before deciding whether to use it.
as to where we're going from here, you're going to look at the components concept.	The industrial designer will look into components
and you're watching trends to see how we go	The marketing expert will be watching trends (possibly relating to voice recognition).
And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on, switching off, uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels, or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel, so we would need the numbers. And and also the volume is very important. But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then, um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu.	She pinpoints the main functions of on/off, channel-switching, numbers for choosing particular channels, and volume; and also suggests adding a menu button to change settings such as brightness on the screen.
So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size. And then it must be easy to use, so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something.	She gives preference to a remote that is small, easy to use, and follows some conventions.
So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design, functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are Um the identification of the components, uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects, I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person. Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level these were the basic findings from today. The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email. as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other. also uh the remote control should be used only for television, because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex. And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television. also the management wants that um our design should be unique so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard. Okay, so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control. there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface. The user interf interface communicates with the chip, if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell, uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip, which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything. There is a user interface here. So whe when the user presses a button, it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal, Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to	The industrial designer gives his presentation, explaining how remote controls function and giving personal preference to a clear, simple design that upgrades the technology as well as incorporates the latest features in chip design.
I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls, uh so mostly just by searching on the web And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities. Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set, And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on, switching off, uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels, or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel, so we would need the numbers. And and also the volume is very important. Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design, like operating a V_C_R_, but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players, but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design. So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size. And then it must be easy to use, so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something. But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then, um for example brightness and mm similar functions could	The interface specialist gives her presentation next, addressing the main purpose of a remote control.
so these are my personal preferences. So you have sleek, stylish, sophisticated, you know, so something that's, you know, a bit cool. Um you know, functional, so it's useful, but minimalist. so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both, Um okay, then a long battery life, like you were talking about earlier and um, you know, I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because, you know, your remote control just sits there, and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit. so you know, kind of like you have for a mobile phone or Some kind of a ring, Whistle and it screams at you, yeah. So yeah, so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps, Um and then like a locator,	She prefers a remote that is sleek, stylish, sophisticated, cool, beautiful, functional, solar-powered, has long battery life, and has a locator.
So, we've got about ten, fifteen minutes to discuss I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people. So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned, if we want to have something sleek and uh you know, good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know, people who are comparatively elderly. I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey, you know, whether, you know, these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control, Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them, Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions. I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five, when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five, uh how popular was Seventy six point three percent. but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income I mean like it is an age group to target, really, I think. and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price, that's not unaffordable, even for young people. but the problem is whether people need it, whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote. I think I think the fact that, you know, ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control, does say quite a lot	They discuss the target group, deciding it should be 15-35 year olds.
and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that. Um well, I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use, or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons so so at this stage, uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want. I mean um what other options would you have? A little screen or something, but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly, not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno. I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons, Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them. So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that. Uh i if the if the costs allow, we can have like an L_C_D_ display because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well.	The group briefly discusses the possibility of using an LCD screen if cost allows it, since it is fancy and fashionable.
So what I have, wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire. What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are, Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know, a nice looking remote control. Um current remote controls, they don't match the user behaviour well, Um I dunno what zapping is, It's um switching between channels, sort of randomly going through. But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on. Um okay, fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons, so that's going back to what, you know, we were saying earlier about, you know, do you need all the buttons on the remote control, they just make it look ugly. Um so this is my little graph thing. what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection. What you can't see is volume selection, it's a little bit higher than all the others. so what the graph shows is that, you know, power, channel selection and volume selection are important, and the rest of them, you know, nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance, you know, and, you know, channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential, and the power, well it's not quite so essential, apparently, um and everything else, I think, you know, you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control, so this is what people find annoying about remote controls. Uh that they get lost, that the uh you know, they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury. you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control but	The marketing expert presents, giving statistical information from a survey of 100 subjects.
now we are here at the functional design meeting. Um hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually. The agenda for the meeting, I put it in the sh shared documents folder. Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through, The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time, Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us. at the last minute, then we need to, by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control You said uh targ target groups, what does that mean? As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to, yeah, we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on Just before you start, to make it easier, would you three mind emailing me your presentations? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back, just so that I don't have to scribble everything down.	The project manager opens the meeting by stating that they will address functional design and then going over the agenda.
Looking at what we've got, we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel. You have to have some push-buttons, don't you? Just spinning and not scrolling, I would say. I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now. but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes, We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel,	The remote will have push buttons outside, and an LCD and spinning wheel inside.
It has to be at least curved from one side, yeah. But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing, effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side, but you folded it in half. Flat on the top. and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself, um made out of rubber	The case will be flat on top and curved on the bottom.
So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go Yeah, I think so. because of style and	The group decides to use LCD screens to give the remote style.
Okay, apparently, fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration. Um so these will be an important feature for clothes, shoes and furniture. So I mean, I'm taking this to mean, you know, curviness. 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables. You know? and possibly even uneven, bit of asymmetry and stuff. But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there, so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand.	She shares that fruits and vegetables are popular, meaning curviness and assymetry are in.
Okay, straight to trends, Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future. Now, the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect, which is twice as important as the third a aspect. So, I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect, really. Um, you know, people want something new, something technologically innovative and different, so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like, quite the thing to go for. So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things, is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here? so probably voice recognition is is kind of important, right? And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning Okay, I I have a point about L_C_D_, W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback, right, to the user who's pressing buttons, and the feedback can come through television itself, so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote? Depends how fast your television runs, really, I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote so i it actually takes quite a long time. so I think, you know, a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that. It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen, But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone, you know, like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control, you know or like a minimalist remote control. So you got your buttons one to nine, your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess	The marketing expert gives her presentation about user requirements and current trends.
So in in the case of many user interfaces, they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing, it takes y know time to learn. and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found. so yeah, they're quite big and have many many buttons. Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one, because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well. And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice. Our own company has developed a new in user interface we can uh include voice recognition i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it. Um s another new development is a scroll button, Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display. And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition, So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include. but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker, there can be a um pre-programmed answer, Um uh are you sure wha what this means, a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display? the scroll button is a different thing. I I have a picture if you just a moment, Oh okay, the iPod thing, yeah. but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel, it's like not separate buttons. It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse, and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower, Do you know, if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through	She mentions that many existing remotes do not have a nice appearance, and states her preference for a remote that is small and simple and contains a scrolling wheel.
and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours, do you know? I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and it's gonna look sort of vegetable, and be in bright vegetable colours.	The remote will resemble a vegetable and be in bright vegetable colors.
Right, interface concept. Um to be honest actually, I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time, I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk. So um yeah, this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again. So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data. So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well, and colour, and so on. Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant. this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product. So in in the case of many user interfaces, they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing, it takes y know time to learn. and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found. so yeah, they're quite big and have many many buttons. Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one, because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well. And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice.	The interface specialist begins presenting, first defining user interface and then showing some examples of remotes.
so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive, so we can put put in uh whatever we want, but the various integrated circuit options are, we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced. okay, so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip. we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels. Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender. besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender, which is did not explained what i what it was, So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know, as soon as you press a button, it it mm uh give gives you feedback, one five or whatever. I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not, but anyway.	He then talks about the type of chip certain features would require.
So the batteries, I'll start with the battery, right? So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells, yeah? And dynamos. So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this, So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones. The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches, since our hand keeps moving, it keeps the watch ticking. But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control, because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes. But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something. And the fourth option is the solar cells, which are also made by the company. Environment friendly. There are different cases that can be provided. They can be basically the shape of the cases, they can be flat, they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat, and they can be curved with on both the sides. Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control, yeah, Yeah, uh there were different kind of supplements available, um like it can be in plastic, rubber, wood, or titanium, right? so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment, so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use, because it relates to the overall image of the company, but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface. the interface options now. we can have push-buttons, like most remotes do Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing. we can have L_C_D_s.	He lists the options for types of batteries, shapes for the remote case, materials to use, and functions to include such as push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCD screens.
so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation, I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead. I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that. Okay, so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control If you open it, you have a circuit board here, right, and this is the chip that I was talking about last time. This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here, which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here. If you flip the printed circuit board, and this is th the most important point here, So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ on pressing this button I a circuit completes, the information goes to the chip, which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation, which goes goes out through there. So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make, so these are the different options that we have.	The industrial designer begins presenting, first describing the insides of a remote control.
I sent you the agenda, it was on the in the project documents. Anyway, it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time, so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to. Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with, so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts, we need to know about the components' properties, materials, the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching.	The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda.
And as well as that, the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay	The two designers will work together on developing a prototype using modeling glay and follow the instructions the group has come up.
and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation.	The Marketing Expert will work on the product evaluation.
the case would be rubber and the the buttons, and the buttons are also rubber.	The remote control and its buttons will be made of rubber.
and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach.	They will get extra instructions from their personal coach
Looking at what we've got, we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel. hand dynamos are definitely out, right? it's not that's not streamlined and sexy, having a having a wind up. kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal, It's about the practicality of it really, isn't it? You know? this this thing will have to be tapped every time, which which might be very frustrating for the user. Depends how much how much movement it really needs. Okay, let's keep it option uh keep an option, Wood, do you think wood will be a good idea? I can't imagine a m wooden remote control. and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences, I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more I mean it's it's alright for a table, And splinters and stuff and You have to have some push-buttons, don't you? I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them, wouldn't you? if you have an L_C_D_ display, then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display. when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing, then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control, I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made, where, you know, the buttons that people use all the time, you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven. I think the thing is, so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel, then it should be easier to use than any other remote, and then if someone wants to, you know, change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible, So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing, Just spinning and not scrolling, I would say. But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber	After they make some decisions about the remote, the project manager closes the meeting by telling them what their tasks will be until the next meeting.
I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them, wouldn't you? I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made, where, you know, the buttons that people use all the time, you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven.	It will have standard on/off, channel-changing, numerical, and volume buttons, with a menu on the screen.
, I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy. Something a bit squishy and So it could be like a rubbery and it'd help if you drop it, So if if we use uh latex cases, they won't allow us to use solar cells, as an energy source Or if we want to use the the latex, then we have to go with one of the other um power things. so um we could use titanium, wood or plastic uh or uh If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there, So probably double curved surface is the way to go, Or or curved at one end and flat on the top, You have to have a certain element of flatness, I think. singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much, does it? so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh and, you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing? because um according to the information that I have, I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three. It does not say anything about uh whether technically, you know, this this stuff is available at all. Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_, which I think is where it came from. But no, my research didn't tell me anything,	They discuss what material should be used, talk about how the surface of the case should look, and plan out the general user interface.
I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost, then I'd put them in, Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s, mm. So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery,	It will have voice recognition, use a simple battery, and contain an advanced chip.
Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design	The Interface Specialist will work on user interface.
In the meantime, the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design,	The Industrial Designer will work on look and feel.
but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps. We're gonna have a beep.	Locator will have a beep instead of a speaker.
costs are within budget, One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee. Um we've evaluated the project. Can you put that in the project documents file? And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with. we've got like five minutes left. but if we've finished, then we've finished. Yeah, it was a pleasure working with you. So I would say that's the end of that meeting. Right, so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it. Was there a questionnaire already sent? Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now? I don't see why you can't stay here, really.	They finish the meeting 5 minutes early and the project manager tells them what is left to complete.
And it's the whole thing's made of rubber, is that	Rubber case material.
So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design. Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale, so one is, you know, yes, it totally meets with that requirement and seven is, no, it really doesn't, we need to go back and start again. Um, you know. Basically, what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them. So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven. I did have A_, B_, C_, and D_ down here, but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points. Okay. But if you can imagine that they say A_, B_, C_, and D_, then that would be really good. Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in. If you take a note of them, left-handed people can't normally write right-handed, Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people, Does it match the operating behaviour of the user? so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version, which is like exactly the mirror image of this one. So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation, maybe give it a five, I would say? Or maybe six, It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up, right, I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top. Yeah, but we which makes it kind of really big, yeah. or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_? th there's the locator dot. Mm that you stick on T_V_. so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though, To make it beep. so that's seven, yeah. If uh uh if this means intuitive	The marketing expert gives the product evaluation, which is based on the criteria of attractiveness, whether it matches operation behavior of the user, locatability, intuitiveness, ergonomic design, and how technologically innovative it is.
One simple battery. The chip, we're going for an advanced chip on print.	Remote uses one simple battery and an advanced chip.
maybe give it a five, I would say? Or maybe six, It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up, right, I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top. Yeah, but we which makes it kind of really big, yeah. so that's seven, yeah. If uh uh if this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things I'd say six, 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one, rather than the way you've got it. but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to. but uh it's a good technology, I mean once they get used to it. So, should we maybe say f a five So, should we give it a six? Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno, I mean the the repetitive stress things, but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway, And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything, so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway. Okay, so we give that a six, What do you reckon, five, six? Six. So, we need the average here, So I think we've done very well, The average is about six and something. Six point five, yeah. that's pretty good, I think.	They rate the product using a 7 point scale and come up with an average score of 6.5.
Yeah, I think um we could do l the logo in grey, as it is on the website.	Corporate logo will be in grey.
so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria. And now we have to calculate the production costs. So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that. Um I started filling it in, No hand dynamo, right? One simple battery. The chip, we're going for an advanced chip on print. We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker. Um single-curved surface, so that we can fold it. Case material we said rubber. I don't know what special colour means. I think something coloured, but rubber comes coloured, doesn't it? You know. maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured, it's different. Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it, We have pushbuttons, Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had, no? And we have L_C_ display And button supplements. Yeah, but what do we ha we have L_C_ display, but but the wh but the s spinning wheel We've got more than one pushbutton though, That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it? That seems unlikely. whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we We have to count all of them, I don't think that makes sense. if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five, it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display, So, as we can see, that's way too expensive down here. Our budget's twelve point five.	The group goes on to calculate the production cost and finds they are over the budget.
So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three And then, well this is on off button. The volume is is scrolling.	Has an on/off button, channel flipping, volume scroller on side.
Yeah, the sample sensor will have to go, 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there. so that has implications though for the. Uh it does not have for voice recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker. when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello. But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really, isn't it? Mm and the locator also goes away. Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive, but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps. A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface, because it's just rubber, so it's probably a flat surface rubber. Right, so we need one fifty off. Take it down to just a scroll wheel. in the L_C_D_ we can scroll, right? how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button. you can push this one, but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing. So that's point three. and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing. The scroll wheel is on the side. We're point three over at the moment. Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume. Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here, up for up and down. Oh look, we're way under budget Yeah, well we could admit to the single curve, couldn't we? Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour. So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria, as a result of doing that? No, I don't think so. Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep L_C_D_ display. instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons. But we lose the locator. so we still have the locate. We're gonna have a beep	They have discussion and decide to eliminate the sample speaker locator and the scroll wheel inside.
I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with. If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like, okay, so we can have that lot, let's just throw it together and do what we can.	This happened because they had not known beforehand the cost of such features.
So, as we can see, that's way too expensive down here. Yeah, the sample sensor will have to go, 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there. Take it down to just a scroll wheel. Right, so we need one fifty off. We're point three over at the moment. Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here, up for up and down. The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had.	The team had to cut out some features in order to make the budget.
and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside.	LCD and push buttons inside flip-open door.
This is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting. what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two, so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently. It does look very cool. then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against. Then I need to say some st a few things about finance, 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria. Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits. Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through.	The project manager opens this detailed design meeting by going over the agenda.
but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to.	It could be more difficult to get used to.
so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things, like the buttons and the scrolling things and Okay. So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana. You think bananas are a safe thing to use? It's a bit um phallic. Well, but it's it's just an a approximation. so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable. yeah, but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing, that one side was supposed to be rounder, Is it to scale, or do you think you can make it a bit smaller? Um it could be made a bit smaller, And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours. Yeah, I think um we could do l the logo in grey, as it is on the website.	The designers present the prototype, which they decided to make the color and shape of a banana.
'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one, rather than the way you've got it. If uh uh if this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things but uh it's a good technology, I mean once they get used to it. but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to.	When rating whether the product is intuitive, the layout is different,a good technology but less standard.
Okay. So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana. And it flips open on the side, so it opens like that.	The remote will be black/yellow color and the shape of a banana.
Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again. And it flips open on the side, so it opens like that. And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside. And it's the whole thing's made of rubber, is that So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things. So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three So it's four, up to four, up to seven, up to nine and zero, z zero here. And then, well this is on off button. and and also the colour is quite often red, And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here, previous and ne prevon prevon next. The volume is is scrolling. On the side, And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid, because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here. and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose. Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button. Well, we'll have this on the screen, on the display. On the wheel, like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute. Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know, the main menu will have various options. yeah, the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right? if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in? But if you hold it in, And okay, so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it. You can't really see it in the interface.	They demonstrate the remote components, showing how it flips open on the side and features a LCD and scroll inside.
left-handed people can't normally write right-handed, Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people, so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version, which is like exactly the mirror image of this one. It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up, right,	When rating the product on how well it matches the user's behavior, they found that the product is more convenient for right-handed people and less so for those who are left-handed.
Right, so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it. Was there a questionnaire already sent?	The team needs to complete the final questionaire and meeting summary.
so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went, um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product. as far as creativity is concerned, yeah I think there was there was room for creativity. The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had. I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with. If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like, okay, so we can have that lot, let's just throw it together and do what we can. But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting, that that worked in terms of. I think 'cause the meetings were so regular, you know. Yeah, the m the means were very very good, the means we used. the whiteboard digital pens. We like the pens. But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint, New ideas found. Not quite sure what about. Well it's it's it's pretty new, I think we'd like to think the ideas were new,	The team discusses the project process- saying that they had to cut out some creativity in order to meet the budget because they had not known the cost of features beforehand.
I was I was satisfied with with the leadership, yeah. Yeah, and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the I mean especially with that last-minute alteration. I mean that was fairly tight anyway, But yeah, but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting, yeah. You weren't like a a dictating leader, so that was always good. And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely, yeah. Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit? Mm. I guess it was a fairly small group, so all of us got to express our opinions, yeah. And my main difficulty was the the time pressure. sometimes it's like a little bit rushed.	They were satisfied with the leadership but felt rushed for time.
Um single-curved surface, so that we can fold it.	Single-curved surface.
User Interface Designer, that's that's so you gotta you go, you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need. Um. Industrial Designer, you are the one, you know, you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in, I guess so, um Mm. Har how it works an And in marketing User requirements specifications. Do you think our two kind of overlap, because Yeah, it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap. You two you two are gonna be just, I think, you just double up, you know, you working together. You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research,	The project manager then further discussed the roles of the team members.
profit aim fifty million Euros.	The profit aim will be 50 million Euro.
Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff, and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel, program plus and minus, and the just the mute button, for example. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though, 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it. No, but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold or something like a flip telephone, something like that maybe.	Having a two sided remote with basic functions on one side and advanced functions on the other.
selling price twenty five Euros,	The selling price of the remote will be 25 Euro.
So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things. but that would p that would probably be quite expensive. I think we should also have a back-up plan of I but also devices connected to the to the T_V_, I mean, be able to operate D_V_D_ players, things like that. 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control, that just that is just for a T_V_, but it's just a really good, nice one.	If the remote should be used only for televisions or if it should be capable of controlling other devices also.
Okay, project finance, selling price twenty five Euros, profit aim fifty million Euros. Market range internationally sold. it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make. Right, who's got experiences with remote controls then? Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make? Yeah. Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control. Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and I mean, you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player, or something like that, but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something. 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices, but that would p that would probably be quite expensive. and then after we after we've found out what we can like, some different ideas, we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not. So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things. Couldn't we have like one that comes out? you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner, and um into one basically. Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff, and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel, program plus and minus, and the just the mute button, for example. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though, 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it. No, but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold or something	The project manager discussed the project finances and the team engaged in a brainstorming session about various features to consider in designing a remote.
So is the agenda? Opening, acquaintance, tool training and project plan, discussion and then closing. Project aim is a new remote control. It's original, uh trendy and it's user-friendly. Try out the whiteboard, every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal. so, I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working.	The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals and discussed why they liked those particular animals.
it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make.	The production cost cannot exceed 12.50 Euro.
I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control, that just that is just for a T_V_, but it's just a really good, nice one.	The team will create a back-up plan for a remote that only controls televisions
Market range internationally sold.	The remote will be sold internationally.
but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_, but also devices connected to the to the T_V_, I mean, be able to operate	The remote will control televisions and devices connected to televisions.
like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones,	The remote will have a lock function.
Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well, something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit. It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_. so, I mean, we are sort of beholden to them. Not one colour, but the pattern needs to be recognisable. but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products	The corporate image will be displayed on the remote.
energy source, that would be batteries.	The remote will use regular batteries.
Yeah, and basically uh, as far as methods, I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes, trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there. And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes, I mean people want a remote that's familiar, that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics, but Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control, uh channel keys up-down, but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want, rather than doing up-down, ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred, judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after, So, the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality, so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use. Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know. what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary? I would say it's If it's simple to do, and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design.	The user interface designer discussed what features the remote was required to have and presented two existing products which were based on different concepts.
I'm gonna draw it on the board then. So um the idea is that we've got the energy source um, So um I think maybe uh two batteries, then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal, which could be uh an infra-red signal, um which will be sent by an electronic chip. Is a battery like the only way of No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying. swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain, but as far as the infra-red signal, do we have control over, you know, how far away you can be from the receiving unit, the the T_V_, and still have it be operational? It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be, you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch, it's not doesn't have to go that far, Well, we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it. Yeah, yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things. How about Bluetooth? Doesn't have to go through a wall, because you're not gonna be looking through a wall.	The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed options for batteries and infra-red signals.
Voice activation might not be the best. I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off.	The remote will not contain a voice activation feature.
so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again. Okay, right, welcome to meeting B_. Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting, basically, uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now. and, uh yeah, I'm just here to sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going, get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically. what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you, We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all. So I want each of your presentations to not be too long, five five minutes, something like that. This meeting it's not very long. It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now. Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy, it doesn't matter,	The project manager had the team members re-introduce themselves and then briefed the team on his own duties and on the meeting agenda.
we should probably consult with our legal department uh. I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting.	The project manager will consult with the legal department to discuss the prevention of lawsuits from consumers claiming the remote caused RSI
we've decided that it's gonna be, you know uh, we're going for a basic television remote. I think, we should just go with the simplest option on everything, uh and that would be infra-red, energy source, that would be batteries. Uh mean we we can look into using the s, you know, the little tiny weeny batteries, all like special long-lasting batteries. Um. So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background, Well, it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders. Can't we have different colours in the remotes, And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups, so, I mean, we are sort of beholden to them. So we have to have it one colour. Not one colour, but the pattern needs to be recognisable. but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products so maybe, so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein, perhaps. But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere	The project manager briefed the team on the decisions made so far and the team discussed color options for the remote.
Well, for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab, So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly. Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user. Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy. I was thinking something easy to use, especially for older people. Um has to look really cool, flashy groovy for people to buy it. and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating. What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost? most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five, It's older generation, they're the ones that have gone out and but the younger generation who we are catering for, like who have most of the money nowadays, do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote. Voice activation might not be the best. I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off. Um also with um with buttons, a thing called R_S_I_, I think we can do some really in in that department, the the ergonomic department, we can make some some really good improvements.	The marketing expert presented research on consumer preferences on remotes in general and on voice recognition and the team discussed the option to have an ergonomically designed remote.
Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well, something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit. It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_. Uh, everything is going t ergonomic, you know,	The project manager then introduced some new requirements to bear in mind when designing the remote.
So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as Can't we have different colours in the remotes, I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background, Well, it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders. And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups, so, I mean, we are sort of beholden to them. So we have to have it one colour. Not one colour, but the pattern needs to be recognisable. but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products so maybe, so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein, perhaps. But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere	What color the remote should be.
and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating. What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost? most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five, It's older generation, they're the ones that have gone out and but the younger generation who we are catering for, like who have most of the money nowadays, do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote. Voice activation might not be the best. I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off.	Whether to include a voice activation feature in the remote.
Uh, everything is going t ergonomic, you know, and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market, I guess. Um. I think we can do some really in in that department, the the ergonomic department, we can make some some really good improvements.	If the remote should have an ergonomic design.
as far as the infra-red signal, do we have control over, you know, how far away you can be from the receiving unit, the the T_V_, and still have it be operational? It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be, you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch, it's not doesn't have to go that far, Well, we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it.	How powerful the infra-red signal should be.
Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know. what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary? I would say it's If it's simple to do,	Whether the remote should have a locking function.
and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market, I guess. Um. I think we can do some really in in that department, the the ergonomic department, we can make some some really good improvements.	The remote will have an ergonomic design.
uh and that would be infra-red, Yeah, yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things. It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be, you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch, it's not doesn't have to go that far, Doesn't have to go through a wall, because you're not gonna be looking through a wall.	The remote will use a regular infra-red signal.
Well, what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit? What about the just developed uh sample sensor? it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like, turn the T_V_ on, and i turns comes on, I'm just guessing. But it's gonna be the most expensive option, probably and a it just gives you a verbal response. Oh, then forget about it.	Whether to have a sample sensor in the remote.
Yeah, I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere, Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like so we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range, the where, you know, you have a variety of colours, that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it, even, you know, just just by the fact of choosing.	What color the remote should be.
Um Gabriel, you're gonna be working on, you know come up with the the user interface design.	The interface specialist will work on the user interface design.
Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery, a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches, You can have a kinetic provision of energy, Or you can use solar cells, but I'm not sure about that indoors, really, but Well, there's sometimes combinations, I mean, like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power. And uh if we want something fancier, I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice, Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery, really. For the case of the remotes itself, um they can be a general case, which is just a flat one. You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one, Um then the case material itself, so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex, uh rubber, wood, or titanium. And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium, you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case, we can't choose titanium. But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything. so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels, like you have on a mouse, um or you could have um L_C_D_, which gives you a display. Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons. Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_, the display thing, then that's even more expensive.	The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries, materials, and components, as well as restrictions involved in combining particular materials, components, and batteries.
Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting. Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing,	The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting.
Okay, so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic. Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products, uh like the coffee machine. they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod. So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface. I guess, we we basically vetoed that idea. but they suggested uh, you know, going i a little bit into a a niche, but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general, but done well. I can give you an example here of uh, good layout and bad layout So this would be an example of bad layout, where you have volume up and volume down, but they have a V_ on both of them, so uh Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose. Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense. I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us. So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh. I think we shall have a limited number of buttons, ideally, I mean a a power, channel up, channel down, volume up, volume down, and a numerical keypad. it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that. Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy, Yeah, I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere, I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before.	The interface specialist presented examples of existing remotes on the market with good and bad layouts and stated what features the remote required.
So that might be an idea of using the rubber, And also it doesn't break as easily maybe, Rubber, we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case? Let's have rubber push buttons, hey. is uh, okay, advanced chip on print, which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender? Well, if if it's not chip on print then, I guess, you get different chip components, and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red. If it's something that's inside the the unit. I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not. So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print. What about the just developed uh sample sensor? I'm just guessing. But it's gonna be the most expensive option, probably and it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like, turn the T_V_ on, and i turns comes on, a it just gives you a verbal response. Oh, then forget about it. So rubber rubber keys, yeah. so we want it rub rubber double curved. But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific	The team then discussed and decided what materials, components, and what type of battery to use in their product.
now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already, that's cheap. I mean it's different, but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy. That's why I was thinking, Bluetooth, 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays, like it really is, they don't really care whether, you know, at the end of the day whether it works properly or not. Of course, they do. So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it, which no no television does, Well, if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it new, you have to make it state of the art. Like it doesn't have to be, you know, Bluetooth, If we want something new, we need to move away from what we already have	This lead to a discussion on whether to use Bluetooth or infra-red technology in remote.
Well, I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have. Um second, uh it should be technologically innovative innovative. Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths, shoes and furniture. Okay, so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them. and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy, Yeah, we're we're ahead of the game there.	The marketing expert discussed research from trendwatching reports, finding that products now require technological innovativeness, a fancy look and feel, a spongy feel, and a fruit and vegetable theme.
That's why I was thinking, Bluetooth, 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays, like it really is, they don't really care whether, you know, at the end of the day whether it works properly or not. Of course, they do. So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it, which no no television does, Well, if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it new, you have to make it state of the art. Like it doesn't have to be, you know, Bluetooth,	Whether to use Bluetooth or infra-red technology in the remote.
from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design.	The industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design.
and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though. Maybe make it like fruity colours or something. The power button could be like a big apple or something. Um like I'm just thinking bright colours. Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like so we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range, the where, you know, you have a variety of colours, that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it, even, you know, just just by the fact of choosing.	The team then discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the remote.
Let's have rubber push buttons, hey. So rubber rubber keys, yeah.	The remote will have rubber push buttons.
Rubber, we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea? so we want it rub rubber double curved.	The case will be made of rubber.
and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though. Maybe make it like fruity colours or something. The power button could be like a big apple or something. Um like I'm just thinking bright colours.	How to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the remote.
Then basically, you two are gonna be working together on this. come up ki you know, be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas. Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay.	The industrial designer and the interface specialist will work on a prototype.
Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation.	The marketing expert will work on the product evaluation
so we want it rub rubber double curved.	The case will be double curved.
So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh.	There will be no display physically featured on the remote itself.
So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print.	The remote will not use a chip on print.
Okay. Yeah, this that's that's very good. right, we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing,	The remote will use a kinetic battery.
We've got a cool prototype. everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber, Double curved. um but also something that was gonna jump out at people, So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand, you'll see what a nice thing we have going here. So, basically, if you hold it like that, the one on your thumb, yeah, the thumb button is the power button. Your index finger is channel up, middle finger is channel down, Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want. but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different. That certainly does. I think it's, well, if the R_R_ motto is, we bring fashion to to electronics, I'd say that could be quite fashionable. And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue.	The interface specialist and industrial designer presented their prototype to the team and discussed the features the prototype contained.
but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one. But, that's I don't see why that's not possible. like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family, what, they have two remotes? Yeah, I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse, and everybody is using right-handed mouse. I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so But we can have both uh Have them in stock.	The need for separate right-handed and left-handed remotes.
Okay, I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know, little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it, during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion, but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and um and then come together and worked in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, and be you know, has been good communication going on. Now you guys have been a a great team. and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before, I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh, you know, after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote, you know. Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that? I love it. I love it. I think it's cool. Um, but a p a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing. It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff, but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text. I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that, it's just the first step.	The team then evaluated the project process, finding that they we
re happy with their product and their performance in the project.
w every everything else was fairly simple, but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new. not if you're left-handed it's not. So that's the evaluation, We've, we've done well. Number one product.	Overall, the prototype performed very well in meeting all the criteria of the evaluation.
so we evaluate each criteria. And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true, so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria, and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria. So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about? I would give it a seven. As in it's not. Oh sorry, one, d yeah. Second criteria, new technology. Well, the kinetic thing, yeah. Maybe three, yeah. So criteria three is is it easy to use? If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one, but otherwise otherwise a two. 'Kay, criteria four is costs. It's come in under budget. So that's a definite one. Amount of buttons. Contains only the necessary buttons. R_S_I_ is it good against? Yes. Very good. does it get lost? I don't think it's gonna get lost easily. But it is smallish. I mean, you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically, but	The team evaluated the prototype on the basis of its look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, costs, and its ability to be misplaced.
One thing I do need to do we need to look at, is the costs. I could do you know, I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you, but it's just easy enough to go through it with you, so we're going for the kinetic power. So the case, we've gone for the double curved. and it's made out of rubber. well they're in diff special colours, Special form, We're under budget. That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make. And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty.	The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and found that their remote was actually under budget and that they could retain all the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost.
I have one thing about it, but it's a small thing, but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one. But, that's I don't see why that's not possible. like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family, what, they have two remotes? Yeah, I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse, and everybody is using right-handed mouse. I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so But we can have both uh Have them in stock.	In presenting the prototype, the issue arose that the prototype could only be used with the right hand.
Um the User Interface Designer, that's for. Technical functions, I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing, the size of the buttons.	The user interface designer will work on technical functions.
I'll look into that.	The project manager will investigate whether the team is to create a remote that is to be sued solely with televisions.
Um the industrial design, Alima will be doing um the working design.	The industrial designer will work on the working design.
just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um, I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls, what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload. especially, like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me, you know, one for the T_V_, one for the digital box, one for m the video recorder as well. Um. And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing, uh too too sort of too sort of complicated they've got too many buttons on them and that there's not too many buttons, they are not too small, like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes. I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for.	The project manager then led the team in a discussion on their experiences with remotes and what features they would like to include in the remote they are producing.
it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes. doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything, you know volume control, on, off, so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's, you know, like the top thing on the remote, I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it, but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here, then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here, all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together, and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day. would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it? are we designing a remote control for a television only Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it? I'll look into that. If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler, If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye, it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons, if we can help it. so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on, off, channel changing, volume, and another rote remote with all the special things.	The team members discussed the option of combining remotes and how to produce a remote which is capable of controlling multiple devices.
Um we're gonna do a little tool training, so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you. Um introduce yourself, and then draw your favourite animal My name is Alima Bucciantini. and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project. I will draw a little turtle for you all. my name is Iain uh and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project. Um. It's a whale, yes. I'm Jessy. Briefly, it's supposed to be a seal.	The team members participated in a tool training exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal on the white-board and discussed why they liked the animal.
and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day.	An additional remote will contain special functions.
We're gonna talk about project finances. we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet, like it's an international market range, Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude, we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro.	The project manager then talked about the project finances and discussed selling prices, profit aim, market range, and production costs.
so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on, off, channel changing, volume, and another rote remote with all the special things.	One remote will contain main functions such as on, off, channel changing, and volume.
Good morning everybody. Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us, for our kick-off meeting. My name is Rose Lindgren. I I'll be the Project Manager. Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project, then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit, including a tool training exercise. And then we'll move into the project plan, do a little discussion	The project manager opened the meeting and introduced herself to the team.
Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude, we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro.	The maximum production cost for the remote is 12.50 Euro.
Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about, it needs to be original, trendy and user-friendly. Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts. First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work, come into a meeting, the conceptional design, individual work and a meeting, and then the detailed design, individual work and a meeting.	The project manager introduced the upcoming project in which the team is to create a remote control.
and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet, like it's an international market range,	The remote will be sold on an international scale.
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it? are we designing a remote control for a television only Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it? I'll look into that. If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler, If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye, it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons, if we can help it.	Whether the team is designing a remote that is to be used solely with televisions or a remote that is to be used with a variety of devices.
it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes. doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything, you know volume control, on, off, so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's, you know, like the top thing on the remote, I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it, but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here, then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here, all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together, and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day. so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on, off, channel changing, volume, and another rote remote with all the special things.	Whether to combine remotes for different devices into one single remote or to have multiple individual remotes.
we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales	The profit aim is fifteen million Euro.
we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales	The remote will be sold for 25 Euro.
Can you e-mail your slides as well? Yes, I yes, I think I can. I'll just attach it to an email. and probably email those out to all of you. Um just including all the things that we talked about. Um.	The project manager will e-mail her slides to the team members
Um user requirements um, so you'll be hearing about different trends, uh about different things that people need,	The project manager will type up the minutes of the current meeting and e-mail those to the team members.
that's that's a good idea, But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone, or like a little cradle for your iPod.	The remote will have a charging station.
'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them, never even have to see them and then you could like pull something out, that had like the main buttons like if it was just a simple, either this way or this way, Which are kind of hidden away in some way	The buttons for extra, infrequently used functions will be hidden in the design in some manner.
Are we gonna use that as one of our functions? I I would say no, because it's gonna add too much to the price. And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises. And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice, like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote It's for, like, the ultimately lazy people,	Whether to include speech recognition in the design of the remote.
if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically, I think, a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this. I do think, who's gonna have the money to buy that also, that one? The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea. that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway, So our target group, we're saying, fifteen to thirty five? I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing S voice recognition, but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something. can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families? It's it's hard to narrow it down.	Deciding on a target group.
We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions.	The remote will have a possibility to get extra functions.
And we want um we want large buttons for the essential things.	The remote will have large buttons for essential functions.
Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost.	The remote will contain a function to aid in its recovery when lost.
Um and finally there's more marketing, I think, um, our corporate image has to be recognisable. while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design.	The corporate image must be recognizable on the remote.
like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television, video, or etcetera. Just for television. That's what we're focused on.	The remote will be used only with televisions.
Si simplicity and fashion. I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages. so it's going to appeal to people, maybe people who have problems with technology, you know, people who get scared by having lots of buttons, maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age, So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is	Rather than define a specific target group by age, the team will define objectives such as fashion and simplicity instead.
Si simplicity and fashion.	The team's design will focus on simplicity and fashion.
User Interface, the user interface concept,	The user interface designer will work on the user interface concept.
I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept,	The industrial designer will work on the components concept.
We didn't bring it up yet, or at all in the meetings so far, but we're not gonna work with teletext	The team will not work with teletext.
market trend wa watching.	The marketing expert will work on trend watching
If everyone could do that as well, that'd be great.	The team members will post their project documentation.
I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls. In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them, um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum. Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control, so it's one that's got lots of buttons, The one on the right is a lot more basic. It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it, Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control. everything you might possibly want to do is there,	He presented two remotes currently on the market and the advantages and disadvantages to each design.
this is our working design presentation. Um I had a bit of some issues with this, because I wasn't able to find everything I needed, what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function. Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder. because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work. So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function. the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that Um the user interface is critical here, because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data, the components that we find here are the energy source, you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work, then the chip, which converts the data, the user that's controlling the chip, and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver. And personal preferences, besides the fact that I can't spell, we need a long-lasting energy source, We need a chip that works well with the user interface, and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal,	The industrial designer described the interior workings of a remote.
requirements. We have a couple new requirements but we're not gonna work with teletext We didn't bring it up yet, or at all in the meetings so far, What's teletext? Uh, it's a British thing. I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser. this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it. and it gives you information, mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing. It's earl it's pretty old technology. like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television, video, or etcetera. Just for television. That's what we're focused on. Um otherwise becomes to complex, Um and finally there's more marketing, I think, um, our corporate image has to be recognisable. while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design. It's It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics. and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in um Looks like, yeah, kind of a yellow and black It's like double R_. we need to talk about our functions and our target group. You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing, you identified that different groups wanted different things if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically, I think, a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this. I do think, who's gonna have the money to buy that also, that one? at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself, The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea. that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway, that's all specific for speech recognition. Are	The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion about their target group, the option to include speech recognition, how to find a remote when lost, and batteries.
Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary.	Each team member will complete a questionnaire and a summary.
After that we have thirty minutes of individual work.	The team members will spend time on their individual work.
Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides.	The project manager will post the minutes and project documentation.
Battery? Do we need a long-life battery? We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all. But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone, or like a little cradle for your iPod. Yeah, that's that's possible. Yeah. that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place.	What sort of battery to use.
This is our functional design meeting. our agenda today um Um. I'm gonna do an opening, did you all get the minutes? I e-mailed them to you. I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder. So um then I we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations. Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received, and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions. Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification, what needs and desires are to be fulfilled, the functions design, what effects the apparatus should have, and the working design, how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function.	The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda.
which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional, What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional, I think it's a lot to do with battery, So 's just the quality of the chip.	How to make infra-red more functional.
I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is. we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked. They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had. Focusing on their desires, um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly, seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that more importantly though, eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote. and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age, so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition, That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes. I think, over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration. People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons, It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is, Repetitive strain injury. So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing, people do not like that, Um looking at the needs people specified, the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour. People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote. People also zap like to change the channel, about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use. So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings, the screen settings and the channel settings, the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were, also just the phenomenon	The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of the appearance and use of remotes, finding that users wanted fancier looking remotes, disliked losing their remotes, wanted remotes with fewer buttons, frequently use the channel changing and volume buttons, and that younger users wanted speech recognition.
I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um. We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is. It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television, it sends a message to the television First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications. so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does, and what the end-user is gonna want from this product. a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product, um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about h how well these particular prototypes work, When a users using a remote control, he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places. So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities. Uh the first of these is is technological uh we need to find a balance between features and price. things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product. Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple, uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often, changing the volume, changing the channel. that's ergonomically designed. I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool.	The user interface designer described how a remote works and how to go about designing one.
my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside, there's something to be said, I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things and then like the the covers could be spongy latex Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex, if if spongy is the in thing. could it be hard, and then something around it? I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing. what I've seen, just not related to this, but of latex cases before, is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside, and it's just covered with the latex.	Whether to use latex or titanium for the case.
I think that's that's one way to go, So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then? we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself, or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display, an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small, Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it, The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control. Uh but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it. I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly, rather than menu as what's on.	Having an LCD on the remote versus a menu that is viewed on the television screen.
or is it li more like a scroll thing? I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod. and you press the centre button, that's that's your all-purpose select button right there. I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume. Do we want a scroll wheel, Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel. It would be nice for changing the volume, but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel. you really need buttons for changing a channel. and the volume would just be like the same way, forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking. When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus. I think yeah, I think a scroll wheel would be nice, but it's not necessary. Um Um And I think if we wanna keep our costs down, we should just go for pushbuttons, For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast, I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel, it's more just to give it a different kind of look, but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool, then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel.	Whether to use a scroll wheel or pushbuttons.
I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple, a regular, or an advanced chip, maybe. if we're gonna have pushbuttons, they require a simple chip, but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip,	Whether to use a simple, regular, or advanced chip.
my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside, Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same, I think. I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions.	What sort of circuit board to use.
Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all? could we go in fruit and vegetable colours? um couple main ones being like, I dunno, lemons or strawberries or something. I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable? Uh like uh I dunno, like uh carrots or something. Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits. What about the idea of like a round remote? Instead of like a vertical up and down one. Like in terms of holding it. Like that's a f shape of a fruit. would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it? Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile? In different fruit and vegetable colours, and then like the the covers could be spongy latex Um and probably in colours, maybe fruity, vegetable colours.	How to incorporate a vegetable and fruit theme into the design of the remote.
and we want a curved case, Or a double-curved?	Whether to have a flat, curved, or double-curved case.
Let's go with a simple chip? Um did we decide on a chip?	The remote will have a simple chip.
we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself, or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast, so we need to find a way of including these somehow. So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then? I think that's that's one way to go, Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display, an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small, Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it, The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control. Uh but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it. I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly, rather than menu as what's on.	The interface specialist also discussed other features to possibly incorporate into the design of the remote, such as an LCD screen.
we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching. that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted, and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year. and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference, but that really, over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes, they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel. And as these are ranked, the top one is doubly important to the second one, which is doubly important to the third one, The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations. And then ease of use was the third most important, And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes, shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy, tight material. And so that brings us to my personal preferences. Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding. Personally, I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale, excuse the pun, um in a year, so and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking. Also, considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction, I'm a little hesitant as to like, how these questions may have been worded, but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what, we have to stress fashion the most.	The marketing expert discussed recent findings from trend watching reports and how to incorporate these findings into the remote design with respect to what materials to use and the overall appearance of the product.
Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all? could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote? If it's latex if it's latexy my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside, there's something to be said, I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things I'm envisioning more like, you know, the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle, could we go in fruit and vegetable colours? um couple main ones being like, I dunno, lemons or strawberries or something. I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable? Uh like uh I dunno, like uh carrots or something. Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits. What about the idea of like a round remote? Instead of like a vertical up and down one. Like in terms of holding it. Like that's a f shape of a fruit. would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it? Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile? In different fruit and vegetable colours,	The team then discussed other options for how they could incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the appearance of their product.
I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod. or is it li more like a scroll thing? and you press the centre button, that's that's your all-purpose select button right there. I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume. I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory, but not as useful in practice. Um I've one more slide before we close, but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things, and then like the the covers could be spongy latex components concept. Energy, chip on print. can you just explain what that is real quick? what do people think about this kinetic battery idea? I think it's awesome. I think it's really cool. as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is, I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced. which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us. Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same, I think. I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions. I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple, a regular, or an advanced chip, maybe. if we're gonna have pushbuttons, they require a simple chip, but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip, Do we want a scroll wheel, Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel. It would be nice for changing the volume, but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel. you really need buttons for changing a channel. and the volume would just be like the same way, forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking. When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you	The team then discussed other options for batteries, chips, buttons, and materials for the case, as well as the option to have a menu function.
Um these are our minutes from r the functional design. We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it, and we said it's for all age groups, different um functions of it. Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion. specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost, large buttons for the essential functions, a possibility for extra functions, like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station.	The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting.
Components design. The main elements of remote controls in general, and therefore ours as well, are the case, the buttons, the circuit board with the chip and the battery. uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do, um there's there's the shape of a case, we could do a flat sh a flat case, a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case. I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet, and we can make our case out of plastic, the m the main base will be plastic, but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in, wood, latex, titanium, rubber or other coloured types of plastic. for buttons we have um pushbuttons, but we also have scror scroll wheels, which can have integrated pushbuttons, and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen. or we could go all high-tech Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one, a regular one or an advanced one, And then battery I think is where things get most exciting. Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries, but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery, Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery. Or a solar battery, although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery. Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago, flashlights. Um personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through, fashion and simplicity. So if we're going for fashion in our cases, I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case, probably with a variety of design elements. Maybe titanium, maybe some wood. We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials, And we wanna go for simplicity. Probably pushbuttons, but I'm sort of intrigued by	The industrial designer discussed possible materials to use in making the case for the remote, options for buttons, and options for batteries.
I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device. so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are We have a number of different choices for a design concept um Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it, we can then design the features around the concept, M we don't want lots of buttons, uh complicated features. Here's a a fairly simple device. This is an an iPod from Apple. Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen. So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have. Um here's a another example. and I think i it looks pretty cool. Uh it's nice and colourful, it's nice and bright. if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever, you can work out which button's which I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often.	The interface specialist presented two existing products which incorporate features the team is seeking to embed in their remote.
um you each have things to do, look and feel design, user interface design, product evaluation,	The marketing specialist will work on product evaluation.
and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay.	Two members of the team will work on creating a prototype using modeling clay.
um you each have things to do, look and feel design, user interface design, product evaluation,	The industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design and will gather more information on curved and double-curved case options.
but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool, then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel. Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex, if if spongy is the in thing. what I've seen, just not related to this, but of latex cases before, is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside, and it's just covered with the latex.	The remote will have a latex case.
what do people think about this kinetic battery idea? I think it's awesome. I think it's really cool. I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case	The remote will use a kinetic battery.
We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it,	The target group comprises of individuals who can afford the product.
um you each have things to do, look and feel design, user interface design, product evaluation,	The interface specialist will continue to work on the interface concept
So we're gonna have like a menu button, uh volume, favourite channels, uh and menu. Pre-set channels	The remote will have a power button, volume buttons, channel preset buttons, and a menu button.
Um And I think if we wanna keep our costs down, we should just go for pushbuttons, we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons,	The remote will have pushbuttons.
Um and probably in colours, maybe fruity, vegetable colours.	The remote will be made in fruity colors.
otherwise the technology today was kinda cool. I got more master classes, what did I get through the corporate website? It's just inspiration about circuit boards. the Excel thing is pretty cool. I learned a lot actually. I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to. I wrote it all down, because I thought it would be relevant, like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control, but then they're like, you don't actually need this I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing. We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much. Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me and I think usually, like whiteboards are good, you know like crossing out ideas, or like if we had had like a brainstorming period. we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it, And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at, like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint 'cause we all needed them separately, kind of on the whiteboards in this room. when you were um creating your um prototypes here, did you work together or did you like do separate projects? Uh we we worked together, we sort of made different shapes well done with the management, I felt well managed. I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time, It's kinda fun. we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings. I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided. But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings, I think the last time we had a lot of information, but at the same time not quite enough, like we we couldn't answer every single question. And I I felt the first two meetings, that	They also further evaluated the project process and discussed what they had learned.
and it's a special colour,	The case will have a special color.
case material is rubber	The case will be made of rubber.
Maybe it's single-curved, It's single curved.	The case will be single curve.
let's have our buttons all be one colour.	The buttons will all be one color.
We have six.	The remote will have six buttons.
but if we had all the buttons in black, and a design in and the outside in yellow, that'd be our corporate one	One of the color concepts for the remote will contain the corporate colors.
Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something? so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it. I think all of them should have an R_R_.	The corporate logo will be on the remote.
Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now. 'cause well, the designs are very bright, so you're right, they're gonna stick out,	There will be no feature to help find the remote when it is misplaced; instead the remote will be in a bright color to address this issue.
is that where people are leaning then, the potato? Variety of colours are nice. I think I'm leaning towards the potato. that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down, that one. Potato.	The remote will resemble the potato prototype.
It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen. and we think that each of these are so distinctive, that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house. we were we were talking about that a little bit but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost. So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno, you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it a little light beep goes off? I think it would be difficult technologically, and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else. There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something, but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon. Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now. 'cause well, the designs are very bright, so you're right, they're gonna stick out,	Whether or not to have a feature which helps find the remote when it is misplaced.
Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria, I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for. I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do, I have to like write something on the whiteboard, so. It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing, It makes look more fruity as well. There it could have a stem like that, is that where people are leaning then, the potato? Variety of colours are nice. I think I'm leaning towards the potato. that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down, that one. Potato. some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to. what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all, or false, First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective. in my opinion the for now at least, the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three. I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two. I dunno if fancy is the word I would use. and same sort of scale for functionality, is it functional? I think it's extremely functional, I think it'll get everything done, then I'm gonna give it a two. Um is it technologically innovative? Mm. Not really, I mean not so much, 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen, the kinetic battery. How many people would notice that, though? And if it's made of like latex, that whole idea, that's pretty cool. Think I'm gonna go with the four as well. Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed	The team conducted a product evaluation of the prototype the team liked the most.
First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective. in my opinion the for now at least, the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three.

Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way. Give it a one. and the next is, does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables? is it gonna be yellow? We might wanna keep it yellow. I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing, but if we had all the buttons in black, and a design in and the outside in yellow, that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours, one a more conservative one, one that's more fruity. Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something? so I think it's pretty fruity. I think i it's kind of mangoey too. That's a much more trendy than a potato um, and does the design match the appropriate behaviour? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons, so I'm gonna give it a one. also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing. Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that	They rated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, functionality, technological innovativeness, sponginess, usability, learn-ability, its ability to be found when misplaced, simplicity, and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic.
we're gonna use a kinetic battery um, we want to use a simple chip, we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu. we made three different prototypes our colours not are not fixed, Uh we have the on off button at the tip, very visible, very big. We have our up and down buttons, which are also gonna be our channel selectors, and we have our little menu button here. If you push if you're just pushing these normally, they're the menu buttons, if uh the volume buttons rather. If you press select once, they become channel changing buttons. That's our number one prototype. The little lightning bolt in it, very cute. We call that one the rhombus, Um this one is known as the potato, It's an ergonomic shape, Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one. Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume. So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here. Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button? it would make it hard to turn the machine off, to turn your T_V_ off. And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear, either way. Um it's a bit different, just a little bit more of a creative feel. Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top. And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional, plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up. We figured it could stand up like this on your table, if you wanted it to, if I made the bot the bottom flat. in terms of making decisions, what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want, then decide what kind of button layout we want, how many buttons, and then to	The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape.
but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost. we were we were talking about that a little bit and we think that each of these are so distinctive, that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house. It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen. So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno, you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it a little light beep goes off? I think it would be difficult technologically, and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else. There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something, but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon. Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now. 'cause well, the designs are very bright, so you're right, they're gonna stick out, it was inspired by the potato,	The team felt it was not necessary to include a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost as the prototype designs were quite bright.
I felt very creative. I think we've been successful I enjoyed making the prototypes. I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information, like what's a single-curved case, but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well. if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables, maybe we could've taken that into account. That was the last one, like I chose not to do a PowerPoint I think we all made um very significant contributions, I don't think anybody dominated it, People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables. I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them. Is the project evaluated? Yes.	The team was generally quite satisfied.
there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary. this is the great product kids, and that we have a market for it, um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results I do like the Martian remote. If we could choose more than one, that would be my second choice. Although the tog toggle I would break it. I would break it. Is it started as a pear, Kind of looks like a penguin, like with no eye. Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over,	After the project manager's closing, the team discussed their personal preferences in terms of the prototypes.
now we're gonna look at finances. Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um, We're using kinetic battery, Simple. Guess it's double-curved. don't we need plastic, and It was rubber and special colour, we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours. I don't know what the se the basic colour is though. like we'll have yellow and black. Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well, And how many buttons do we have? We have six. the case material will just have one colour, but then the buttons will be in special colours? Special form? I think they're fine. Material, we want them rubber as well probably, yeah. Thirteen point seven. what can we reduce? let's have our buttons all be one colour. Maybe it's single-curved, It's single curved. case material is rubber and it's a special colour, It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen. Now it's twelve. What was our target price again? Twelve point five. So we're okay, I think. Um are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro? Yes. I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally,	The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost.
Let's move on to the project evaluation. Project process. Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, the means, any new ideas found. So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project, the information we got on the news, how we used it, if we were able to um, you know, use our creativity with the information, um how how well I guess I led it, um the how well we worked together as a team, um the digital pens, the whiteboard. I felt very creative. I think we've been successful I enjoyed making the prototypes. I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information, like what's a single-curved case, but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well. if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables, maybe we could've taken that into account. I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally, That was the last one, like I chose not to do a PowerPoint I think we all made um very significant contributions, I don't think anybody dominated it, Mm. What did we find for new ideas? People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables. I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them. Is the project evaluated? Yes.	The project manager then led the team in a project evaluation in which the team evaluated how they created the project, the information they found and used, their creativity, their teamwork, and the materials they had at their disposal.
we're making a remote control Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible, and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible	The Project Manager presented the project to the other participants by discussing the aim of creating a new, fashionable remote control device and defined the roles and tasks of each participant.
I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents,	The Project Manager will prepare a report of the initial ideas discussed during the meeting.
for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it, I'm a excellent Project Manager. Um. I'm Marty, I'm Sarah, and I'm the Marketing Manager or something. I'm Ron. and I am the User Interface Designer. I'm Nathan,	The group introduced themselves to each other and trained themselves how to use the whiteboard tools.
one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably. we can't kind of build it into other uh products. For instance like a mobile phone or something like that. Maybe a remote with changeable faces, like the faces that you can buy for phones.	The group decided to consider the following features for the remote control device: universal compatibility with different types of video formatting, combination with other types of devices, and interchangeable faceplates.
one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably. we can't kind of build it into other uh products. For instance like a mobile phone or something like that. Maybe a remote with changeable faces, like the faces that you can buy for phones. does anybody have any initial ideas? as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do, like your microwave or your front door But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things. maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote? I think, making it out of a nice material would be very important, I think, it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device, maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote. Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that you could place something else and it makes the remote page. so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to,	The group then began a discussion of their initial ideas about the remote control and possible features.
I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents,	The Project Manager announced that he would make a report containing the discussion of the group's initial ideas about the device.
uh project finance. what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros. Um. the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it. Eur internationally. Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty.	The Project Manager discussed the financial goals of the project, including the projected profit aim and price point for the device.
I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want. Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done, like what the basic function of it.	The Project Manager gave each participant their assignments.
Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there	The User Interface Designer will receive further assignments at a later time.
um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done, like what the basic function of it.	The Industrial Designer will prepare a definition of the basic functions that the remote control device will have.
I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want.	The Marketing Expert will define the needs and desires of the user.
um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. um think we're constrained to plastics based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased	The group decided to use plastic as their casing material instead of metal.
it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device. Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there.	The company logo will appear in a brief flash in the boot-up screen of the device.
Gotta wonder though, if we're adding so much technology to this one remote, are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things. It seems like, we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip. I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen? But then again that costs as well.	The group had problems with sacrificing popular features in order to stay within the project budget.
I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders. and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference. I've put my files in the shared folder as well.	The Project Manager will post the discussion notes and the meeting's minutes to be available to all the participants.
I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. Um Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simpler functions, so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to, you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted, thought about voice control, um so do we wanna go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic, if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um. We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so. So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic. uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics we've got this idea, Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um, this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable, um at least for the basic controls, you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say um volume up. I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology. With a simple command like locate. And then it could start to beep The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find. but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button, maybe that could be voice activated too. A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television. but yeah I like that, I like that, the voice recognition for the paging system. The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control	The group discussed in more detail the features that will be added to the device: the possible applications of voice recognition, the touch screen menu interface, faceplates, and the look of the company logo.
I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices. Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time, everybody's used to using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume, the majority of the time that's all that's going on, for some people they're important, the other functions happen, but the primary uses are really really basic. Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use, they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with. And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people, their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it. And then they can't find it in the room. So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, will really come into play with a lot of these people. Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes, and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful, and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options. I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically, but it is s something worth thinking about, especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing, Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are	The Marketing Expert made a presentation of the needs and the desires of the consumer and emphasized simplicity as one of the most desired features.
Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well. Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation. Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device, it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem. Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set. Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television, uh switch to the next channel, that sort of thing, some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it. Um. Another remote control, slightly different, it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions, um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use. Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring. my personal preferences. Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control. Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with. Um. Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face	The User Interface Designer presented the technical functions of remote controls and compared the interfaces of two existing remote control products.
I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project. Um remote control works as follows. Um sends message to another system, there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power, something along those lines, there's an integrated circuit, which is the microchip, and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system. A user interface controls the chip, basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well. and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands. And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals. Um too much metal is used sometimes and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire just think of those lawsuits, that'd be really bad. Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction. Um, components. Just some ideas that I had, um, energy source, it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup. Um the user interface, since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic. The chip, um, silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that, Um, the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard, Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range. Um personal preferences, I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal, which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value, Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers, or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice, Yeah that shouldn't be a problem.	The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic components of a remote control device, and advised the group to use plastic for the casing material instead of metal.
I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control. And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion. what I've just found out from the board but it needs to be television only. we're not doing D_V_D_, Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it. that's red and black. And it has to have the slogan, case you guys forget the slogan it's, we put fashion in electronics. Um and no teletext. I'm not sure what teletext is so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design. For reasons that I don't really know. but it's the board so there you go. given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later	The Project Manager went over new requirements for the project: that the device was solely to control television, and that there would not be a teletext component.
have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um Yeah I think that would be best. With a touch screen for the basic functions. Um	The group decided to keep the touch screen interface, and to keep the main interface simple.
So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic. I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group, aim it at them,	The marketing will be focused towards the youth market.
I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology. With a simple command like locate. And then it could start to beep but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button, maybe that could be voice activated too. A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television. Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control to emit some kind of paging. Just a beep.	The remote will have a locating device that operates either through voice recognition or through paging.
And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth, we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel, if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit. something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it. Just kind of the squishy feel. let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control.	They discussed using rubber for the case.
Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think, I dunno, what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point? I think it's our most marketable feature But can we really afford it My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote, that's just an estimate though. it's just, it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money. Where do you guys come up with these numbers? That's just off the top of my head, I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote, you're gonna expect it to do something we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five, sell 'em for thirty, but that's something that we can have finance deal with. Um, I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen and we can look into this other manufacturing option, and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper. let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here. I mean I think that we really have two main selling points, 'cause with voice recognition I think that our casing and the voice recognition I mean, if if we're looking at bottom line, now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on, I think we might have to drop the voice rec. I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely. To be honest, we have the capa we have the design in-house, I mean we've we've come up with this, with this new voice What do you think on it Nathan? About the voice rec? I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say. and they said they wanted voice recognition. Course	They discussed the costs and benefits of using either voice recognition or the touch screen interface, and decided on voice recognition based on their marketing data that favored it.
Now we kind of have to come to some decisions, and all three of us can have a chat about it. Um.	The group then discussed the features of the device.
If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that, kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something. Why, why moving away from hand-held, why? if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point. if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job. Do you think people that are people that buy a remote, are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people, like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too, we have to have buttons on it too as well. I mean, why not have a little rounded kind of thing, it could still have the basic buttons on it. And maybe a menu button and so forth, use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote. I'm thinking of the airport portal, you know like that little pod looking thing? I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um Terracotta bowl or something.	The group discussed the non-traditional look the device could have since the voice recognition would allow it to be stationary.
You discussed either a lithium or a solar power. Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition? Um, the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed, we should install a small backup battery. we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere it works about the same as a solar powered calculator, and you know how those those don't really require that much light, I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said.	They decided to use solar power to power the device.
Um, basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields, to see sort of what's what's trendy, what's new, what's happening. Um, remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer, fancier, more exciting um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface. Um the challenge is that current trends right now, across the board in fashion, in furniture, in technology, is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing. Now I'm not saying we should have, you know, tomato shaped remote controls or anything, but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours, like if wood is an option, that whole organic, sleek, clean, Different skin options, and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy, though if we can get around to getting piloting, I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin, but like a holder almost if you could do like um, leather options or wood options or something As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case, it has a consistency of those stress balls. I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now. but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue.	The Marketing Expert presented market trends and the organic trend that this project would adopt.
basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that. Um, components of a remote control, okay. We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail Energy source, um, our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources, your standard battery, solar cells. Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium if we do go that route, we might have to look elsewhere. Um, and also there's a kinetic energy possibility. Basically, it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running. but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen. Um, the case, we have a few options, plastic, rubber or wood. Um and then as far as the way it's shaped, we can do standard boring flat, which we probably don't wanna do, curved or very sexy double curved. What kind of th thickness are we looking at? Um, I imagine that we could specify. Um, the buttons, there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer, but to use those we'd have to use more chips, And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that. touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro. Um, one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum. So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote, just kind of as a fun gimmick. So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when	The Industrial Designer presented an analysis of cost and the manufacturing options that were available to the group.
interface concept by your faithful user interface designer. So yur user interface, guys, is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear, or otherwise uh perceive. Uh, commands and mechanisms, that basically user uses to control the operator operating system. Here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today. the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts. Uh voice recognition, we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples, um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control. our design team, research team, has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses. Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice, Good morning Joe. Um. Um, another concept is what uh Apple has come up with, the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button, kind of like a modern a bit bulky, a bit crazy, I don't think that's we're necessarily going for. And uh some special components, uh ideas like uh blocking, having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue. Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here. Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose. so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking	The User Interface Designer presented several interface concepts including voice recognition, a spinning wheel design, and a touch screen interface.
Um, the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed, we should install a small backup battery.	The device will be powered by solar power, with a small backup battery.
like if wood is an option, that whole organic, sleek, clean, Different skin options, though if we can get around to getting piloting, I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin, but like a holder almost if you could do like um, leather options or wood options or something As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case, it has a consistency of those stress balls. I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now. I like the idea of of rubber too I think that goes against the whole fancy something, a new line,	She discussed materials that could be used to follow this trend.
That's just off the top of my head, Where do you guys come up with these numbers? Um, this is just off the top of my head keep in mind, Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost, I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers	The participants had problems projecting how much each added feature would drive up the price point of the device because there was a lack of data on manufacturing cost.
touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro. But can we really afford it My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote, that's just an estimate though. it's just, it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money. Where do you guys come up with these numbers? That's just off the top of my head, Um, I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen I mean, if if we're looking at bottom line, now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on, I think we might have to drop the voice rec. I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely. I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up Does having both really up our costs? I can't see how it wouldn't, so we have to pick between one of the two. Um. we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent. Um, this is just off the top of my head keep in mind,	There were difficulties deciding between adding extra features and staying within the project budget.
although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions, they should be secondary, at least if not functionally then visually, Like maybe have menu things. If, if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things. we could do a slide or a compartment, Or you know, a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing, like on um like on a D_V_D_ player. we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use, are we going to use scroll buttons? Rubber buttons? Um it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people? because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously, but obviously having more cases also costs more you could have uh a, you know, a um uh kind of a natural wood colour, like a stained wood and um, I don't know, olive green or something. That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing. let's work on uh multiple case colours.	The group talked about hiding the complicated functions from the main interface, using rubber for the buttons, and having different cases to suit different tastes.
Nathan, I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel, Um, what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype.	The Industrial Designer will build the look of the device using the new manufacturing constraints that were presented.
Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype, um using um prototype building materials um.	The Industrial Designer, the User Interface Designer, and the Marketing Expert were instructed to work together on making the prototype of the remote control.
Um, and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff.	The Marketing Expert was instructed to check the evaluations of the prototype.
And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple.	The User Interface Designer was assigned the task of making the design layout of the device.
let's work on uh multiple case colours.	The group decided to have optional alternative cases for the device to suit different consumer tastes.
We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition.	The group realized that it would be too costly to add both a voice recognition component and a touch screen, so they decided between the two and will now only add the voice recognition component.
And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth, we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel, Just kind of the squishy feel.	The remote control will be made of a soft rubber material.
If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job. stick with the same kind of kinda yeah, the same basic non-remote kind of remote design.	It was also decided that the remote will not have the traditional look of a hand-held remote since it can be stationary with voice recognition software.
I got this slide from the coach this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair, um. Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um and I'm not sure what it's connected to. I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked, I guess, um. As in within the team or? I think so yeah. Are we considering these points here? I think they're starting blocks I think in general, for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive, considering the little amount of input we had going in. Um, and the technology has definitely been a help, it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff. We didn't use the whiteboard at all. No, no whiteboard. and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints, doesn't really matter. Um, also had I not been intrigued about the pen, I don't think I woulda used it at all, I didn't write barely anything. Was pretty cool tack though. I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach. Attempts to contact coach ineffective. n I think there was a lot of room for creativity, we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us, um. And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be. I think, yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually, I mean. I think the teamwork was good as well. My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with, You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours. What did you guys think about the the the roles? I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the	The group then evaluated the project process and discussed their effectiveness as a group.
we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us, um.	They also felt it difficult to bring creativity to the project because of the budget constraints.
I guess now we just go to the project evaluation basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do, these are the things that look like we feel they're important. Um so I was looking at basic design things, are technologies up to where we hoped they would be Is the design what we wanted it to do? and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for? Um. Does it respond to voice recognition? Um, the only thing is with with the pull-out panel, that is, can it take some adjusting And overall, in general, it looks like it's coming up to par. but then, once you get used to it, it does make a lot of sense. So I think overall we're headed in the right direction. They like that spongy feel. I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff, I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel	The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype and showed that the prototype had met many of the initial goals.
Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day. but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all. Nothing, I didn't even get an email, I feel like that was slightly lacking when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more,	The group encountered a problem with a lack of information about their specific tasks.
but we just went for a classic rubber button	They also decided to use classic rubber buttons instead of more costly scroll buttons.
Um, what we need to discuss now is the finance of it, um you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice. Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance. Um, it's a spreadsheet of the parts and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um. if we can just itemize what's in here, it's a solar cell thing With a back-up battery? The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area. Yeah. It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time Um and the case, it's more of a single-curved case, Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout. Um. Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well, 'Cause it i it is very unconventional, M come in at sixteen? a bit over budget, um. what we could do perhaps, a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells um or take out the back-up battery. Uh I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features, being environmental and without the batteries and what not, I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time and saying oh look my remote isn't working I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery, I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural, new thing, but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean that's what sets us apart perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into	The Project Manager presented what each component cost, which showed that the project was going over the alotted budget; the group decided to remove the solar panel.
we have assembled our prototype, um. Um, we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting, um. Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions, um. This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here, d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons. And then, for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on. and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away, um. As far as the uh whole visible light thing, we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out, Of course, if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off. Um. we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity of course that's uh interchangeable and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there. Um. So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption. if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel, clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available. Um I worried about the materials, uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped. and if you touch	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer then presented the prototype that featured voice recognition, interchangeable cases, visible light, and a soft casing material.
As far as the uh whole visible light thing, we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out,	The designers of the prototype decided to use several different colors in the visible light stream in the device.
what we could do perhaps, a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget and maybe move ahead with the project, without the solar cell. I think unfortunately that's our best option.	The group decided to remove the solar panel in order to keep the price point of the device close to the original goal.
I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well, or as much as seems like	The Project Manager will create a final report containing the summary of the meeting proceedings, including the evaluation of the project process.
we've established that the costs weren't really within budget, We did the project evaluation based on um Sarah's evaluation of on off switches though it was really technically an evaluation of the product, not the project in general. And it's all recorded, I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well, or as much as seems like uh I will save this into the project documents. You guys ready to celebrate? that's our last step. Celebration. I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part. I guess we'll call that a a doner. that's the end of the meeting.	The Project Manager summarized the proceedings of the meeting which will go into a final report, along with comments made during the project evaluation.
here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting. um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting, basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer, uh or from Nathan, and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition, I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice. That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users. the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at.	The Project Manager opened the meeting by reviewing the decisions from the previous meeting (to use voice recognition instead of the touch screen, to hide the complicated features, and to start building the prototype).
And U_I_D_, the technical fun functions design,	The User Interface Designer will work on the technical function design.
It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal. and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product, how it feels in your hand. They want the ergonomic ones. If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more. What kinda battery would we want to use? Double A_. So double or triple? it's okay, we don't have to decide about it now,	They discussed making the remote universally compatible and ergonomically-designed, and types of batteries to use.
And the marketing person, that's Courtney, is going to do the user requirements specification.	The Marketing Expert will research user requirements.
you're going to think about the working design.	The Industrial Designer will work on the internal working design.
First we're gonna start off by using our tools. I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing. Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal.	She then introduced a tool training exercise to acquaint the group with the meeting-room tools and to help them get to know each other.
Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing. Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager. And I know all your names again, Courtney, Fenella and Amber. Okay, here is our agenda for this meeting. Um tool training, we're going to, I guess, figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles. Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting. We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original, trendy and also user-friendly. We're gonna have discuss the functional design first, how is it gonna be used, what's the actual goal here, it has to operate T_V_, blah blah blah. And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet. Same thing with conceptual design. And then the detailed design, just more in-depth, get the actual schematics of the remote.	The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave an agenda for the project as a whole.
Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss. Expe our experiences with remote controls um, our first ideas about this new remote, anything that you can bring to the table for this project. Well, we wanna make a multifunctional remote,	The group then began a discussion about features of remote controls and their own  experiences with them.
Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro, and our profit aim is fifty million Euro. We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States, in Europe, in Asia. And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote.	The Project Manager then presented the project budget to the group and presented the projected profit aim, the production cost, and the price point of the device.
The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept,	The Industrial Designer will prepare the components concept for the device.
um U_I_D_ the user interface concept,	The User Interface Designer will prepare the interface concept for the device.
And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo.	The remote will include the company color and logo in its design.
and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device, too. we we need a like homing device.	The group will consider including speech recognition and a locator function in the functional design.
The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept, um U_I_D_ the user interface concept, and you're going to do some trend watching.	The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to prepare the components concept, the User Interface Designer to prepare the interface concept, and the Marketing Expert to prepare a trendwatching report.
but the other bulb, I think, is good to just to indicate, I'm doing something, it's sort of like a reassurance. Like that we know the battery's working.	The remote will feature an extra lightbulb that will light up when the remote is communicating with the television.
Well, should it be larger buttons in general, I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles.	The interface will contain larger buttons.
and you're going to do some trend watching.	The Marketing Expert will prepare a trendwatching report.
We need a power source, we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional.	The remote will feature a smart processor chip to accomodate all of the remote's functions.
'Kay. Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one, 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating. Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip. Um power source, I figured, batteries, Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s, sometimes three. so a large on-off button would probably be good.	The Industrial Designer presented her internal design of the device and discussed the processor chip and the energy sources that will be integrated.
So no D_V_D_, no TiVo, no stereo. So we've simplified, we don't need all those um play, fast-forward, rewind, or no menu buttons. So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off, volume, mute, channel up and down, um the numbers So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed,	There will be no buttons for controlling a VCR or other device; the interface will feature only channel and volume up/down buttons, a number pad, and a menu button to access the menu functions on a television.
Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness, but the other bulb, I think, is good to just to indicate, I'm doing something, it's sort of like a reassurance. Like that we know the battery's working.	She suggested integrating an extra lightbulb that lit up when the remote was communicating with the television.
Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements. okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab, and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire, Seventy five percent think they're ugly. Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more, which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier, And we need we need it to be simple, yet it needs to be high-tech looking. So What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user, like they have to press the buttons. I I think it's like the engineering versus user, And so people say that they typically lose it, and R_S_I_, I'm not very sure what that is. Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is? Uh yeah, that's what my web site said, I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly. And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing Didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it We could definitely include that if we wanted to.	The Marketing Expert presented feedback from users, showing that users want a simple but fancy-looking remote control and that young users want speech recognition.
Would it just be universal for everyone, you think? Because I think even if something has large buttons, as long as they are not childishly large, like even technically non-technically challenged people are gonna use it.	The device will be marketed to all age groups, and made simple for those with less technical skills.
and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there, because they only use ten percent of the buttons really.	She discussed including only the most basic functions in the interface.
we we need a like homing device. And on the charger, just like a phone, like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger, and if you d leave your phone somewhere, you push the button to find it, and it finds th the phone beeps for you. Well, if you have the base, you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery. Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually. If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic. It's really the people twenty five to thirty five. and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device, too.	They had a discussion about possibly including a locator function and speech recognition.
And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo. We could just have the logo in yellow, or maybe a yellow light for the keys. If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it, just like yellow with the R_R_. Well, do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine? Well, we definitely need those. So we've simplified, we don't need all those um play, fast-forward, rewind, or no menu buttons. So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off, volume, mute, channel up and down, um the numbers Yeah, audi audio settings and screen settings, we need those or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself? I think that that's fine just for the T_V_. you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons.	They discussed integrating the company's yellow color and logo into the design, and decreasing the number of buttons in the main interface.
New product requirements. First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote. so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote. But it's becoming out-dated now, because of the Internet. Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news, So no D_V_D_, no TiVo, no stereo.	The Project Manager gave the group new requirements for the product design.
Would it just be universal for everyone, you think? Because I think even if something has large buttons, as long as they are not childishly large, like even technically non-technically challenged people are gonna use it. so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range	The group discussed marketing the product to a wide range of customers.
the function of a remote control, as what uh we've been informed, is basically to send messages to the television set, for example, switch it on, switch it off, go to this channel, go to channel nine, turn the volume up, etcetera. whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen, things like that, all the more complicated functions of menus. And we can decide if that's what we want,, um if we want to include that on the remote, if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself, for example. These are two examples. Um and you can see on the left, it's got a lot more buttons, And then on the right, it's a lot more simpler, And then lastly, it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include, and how simple, complex it should be?	The User Interface Designer presented the basic functions of the device and discussed the designs of two existing products, showing an example of the simple design that the group wants to implement.
because we could produce, you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour. uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power, I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex, um we could do f a cherry cover for this year So we could do like a b a hard base plastic, and then we could give two latex covers to start.	The remote will be covered by a soft latex casing that can be changed.
I think if we had a a locating device with the small one, I think that seems way more advanced.	The device be small and compact and will feature a locator function that uses voice recognition.
Okay, so trend watching. fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like, fancy versus functional, and then it has to also be technologically innovative, and yet easy to use. So the customer basically is confused. um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year. um we need easy to read like large buttons, clearly labelled	The Marketing Expert presented more information on user requirements which showed that users wanted the look of a high-tech device that was still simple to use.
I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost, you know. because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time.	Voice recognition will not be incorporated for other functions.
So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing, shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns. Um. But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns, I don't know if we really want to go with that,	She presented the fruit and vegetable fashion trend that the group will integrate into their design.
so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be. Like a little cut-out kind of Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact, they could illuminate yellow.	To incorporate the company logo and color, the buttons will be illuminated yellow when pressed and the logo will be displayed through a cutout in the latex casing.
looking at the interface concept, it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this. Um uh can't really see, but there's two possible ways, on the r left, if you see on th on the sides of of the remote, you have the sort of scroll down, And then on the right, we have what's really big trend right now, it's the iPod. and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip, but also very sleek and um and very simple, but technologically advanced. Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight. for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow. Um this is particularly geared towards children. Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking. and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_, Real Reaction. But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying, well out of this one we like, you know the round section of um, b or we'd like the the button size on this.	The User Interface Designer presented several ideas for the interface design taken from existing product designs.
So basic remote operation runs as follows, we need rubber for buttons, aluminium for battery y contacts, integrated circuit which consists of a diode, transistor, resonator, resistors, and a capacitator, um contact discs for the buttons, plastic for the casing, and a power-source, whatever power-source we've actually determined we want. They suggested power options, solar cells, hand dynamo, and kinetic power, Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works, We can offer options for casing such as straight, curved, double-curved, you know, very specific to the customer. Um certain restrictions do apply here though. And uh so you functions what for the buttons, scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves. Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip, which we could utilise. Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip.	The Industrial Designer discussed the necessary internal components and presented options for energy sources and materials.
Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before, and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition. um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for So, you would say like, good morning, coffeemaker, and it would respond, good morning, Jill, I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work, 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions. I feel like voice recognition would be, I don't know, w it would be too hard to really	The User Interface Designer also presented the sample speaker technology recently developed by the company.
I feel like voice recognition would be, I don't know, w it would be too hard to really If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would, you know, technology But, I guess, we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway. let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost. Um. It's not gonna be a huge universal remote. 'cause it still fits in your hand, so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial, but not necessarily full of buttons. If we do a voice-activated locator, though, we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip. Okay, so what kind of material do we want to be made out of? I don't think wood is a viable option. 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium, I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of Are we gonna go with the voice activated Uh and what size batteries, double A_, triple A_? or we could do one small lithium, I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial, 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle, then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are, because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it? which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side, Well, the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side. Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that. I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though, or if	The group had a discussion to finalize the prototype features.
Honestly, I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base I think if we had a a locating device with the small one, I think that seems way more advanced.	It was decided that the device will be small with a locator function instead of having a charging stand.
I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost, you know. because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time.	Voice recognition will not be included outside of the locator function.
uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power, I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex, because we could produce, you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour. um we could do f a cherry cover for this year So we could do like a b a hard base plastic, and then we could give two latex covers to start.	It will be covered by interchangeable latex casings.
'Kay. And you're gonna do some product evaluation.	The Marketing Expert will prepare a prototype evaluation.
the U_I_D_ the user interface design. The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design, Okay, and right now, the I_D_ and U_I_D_, you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay. I think you're going to get a lot of, I mean, the final say on what buttons get put	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to build the prototype; the User Interface Designer will decide which buttons will be included and the Industrial Designer will focus on the look and the materials.
'Kay. And you're gonna do some product evaluation.	The Marketing Expert will prepare a prototype evaluation.
I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of	There will be only one design of the remote rather than producing it in several different materials.
not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of	Several of the features that the group had wanted to include were no longer possible due to time and cost restraints, or constraints from the materials themselves.
so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be. Like a little cut-out kind of Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact, they could illuminate yellow.	To incorporate the company logo and color, the buttons will be illuminated yellow when pressed and the logo will be displayed through the latex casings.
The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design, the U_I_D_ the user interface design. Okay, and right now, the I_D_ and U_I_D_, you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay. I think you're going to get a lot of, I mean, the final say on what buttons get put	The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to build the prototype, with the User Interface Designer deciding which buttons will be included.
I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about. Feel good meaning what? Physically, Yeah, it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it. Okay so, we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale, do we feel it's very easy to use? Two. That's what I say. Okay, fashionable? I mean like no, I think it's very fashionable. I'll give it a two, because at the moment it's not looking that way. Mm I don't think it's that fashionable. does it feel good? And it's i it is very ergonomically designed. Alright, average is two. Is it technologically innovative? does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it? We could do it with the chip, yes. And there's no way you can represent it on here. Y so I'd probably give it a three. But it is just a T_V_ remote. It's just trendy, basically. It's capable of being squishy and fruity.	The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the prototype using the group's initial criteria for the remote.
So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner,	The group decided that enough of their initial ideas and criteria for the remote were satisfied to be able to continue with the project.
let's have the prototype presentation. The base is gonna be gunmetal gray, which is what we had decided, and it's gonna be plastic. Um then there's the latex cover, which is what you see as red. Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue, almost see-through. The whole thing lights up if you press any button, rather than it just that one button will light up. Um and then at the bottom we have our logo. And then on the side you have the buttons. and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of, I think you did an awesome job.	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed its gunmetal color, removable casing, buttons, logo, and ergonomic design.
this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s, Oh, let's just go for a lithium.	The group decided to use one lithium battery instead of several triple A alkaline batteries in order to reduce the number of components.
Mm. Well, we're under cost then. We've got eleven point two. So we can go to production.	The group decided that the prototype and the final production cost satisfied enough of their initial criteria to able to continue with the project.
We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself, in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote, initially. We didn't have a whiteboard. And no internet. but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only. I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs.	They complained, though, that they felt constrained by the management's directives, that they had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment, and that they did not have internet access during the project.
We didn't have a whiteboard.	The group had problems with some of the meeting-room equipment.
We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself, in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote, initially. but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only. I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs.	The group felt that their options were constrained by the management's directives.
and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary,	All participants were instructed to fill out a final questionnaire.
Now we're gonna talk about the project process Yeah, digital pens. I really appreciated those, yeah. The use of the laptops for receiving everything.	The Project Manager then led a discussion on the project process.
Oh, overall I mean I thought we did a good job like minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it. and we've all been a pretty congenial team here, I think.	The group felt that they worked well together and were pleased with the prototype.
Okay, so now uh we're moving on to finance, Um it's not hand dynamo, it's powered by battery, so we give it a Do I just put quantity being one battery, or And special colour. We're really having just push-button interface. button supplements the buttons are no Um they're uh they're a special form, 'cause they're indented. Mm. Well, we're under cost then. We've got eleven point two. So we can go to production.	The Project Manager analyzed the final production cost; the cost was lower than initially projected, at 11.2 Euros.
and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary,	All participants will fill out a final questionnaire.
Do I just put quantity being one battery, or this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s, Oh, let's just go for a lithium.	The group decided to use one lithium battery instead of several triple A alkaline batteries.
And no internet.	The group complained of not having access to the internet while working on the project.
The Industrial Designer, um is going to be looking more into the working design.	The Industrial Designer will research the working design and components.
and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um Water resistant. maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot. Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it, like so you can clip it to your	They also suggested making the remote water-resistant and including a clip.
The Industrial Designer, um is going to be looking more into the working design. User Interface Designer. I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w So technical function. What is technical functions exactl What effect should the thing ha should it have, And the M_E_, what does that stand for? M Marketing, right. Um. So we'll be working on the user requirements, um	The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to research the working design and components, the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions, and the Marketing Expert to research user requirements.
Um, I think one thing is that it should be easy to find I mean you always know where your T_V_ is, so just have a call button, so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control. Um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing. What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base. But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing, a pretty object attached to the wall. Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose, or does that not factor in? Hand-sized.	They complained that remotes got lost too easily, and suggested using a locator function.
I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons, but like, I don't know you, just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like, no, you never use half of them. So. but what if it had like a little screen, so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions. so you can programme like your favourite channels, But, would you have the screen on the thing, or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen. so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen, I mean, we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device.	They also complained that remotes had too many buttons, and suggested incorporating a screen to simplify the interface but retain all of the functions.
Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro. Um, and we will hope to sell this internationally. How many should we sell then? well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty, that'll do four million.	The Project Manager presented the projected profit and price point.
User Interface Designer. I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w So technical function.	The User Interface Designer will research the technical functions.
Experience with remote control. Um, I think one thing is that it should be easy to find I mean you always know where your T_V_ is, so just have a call button, so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control. Um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing. What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base.

Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it, like so you can clip it to your	The group discussed their experiences with remote controls.
So we'll be working on the user requirements, um Marketing, right. Um.	The Marketing Expert will research user requirements.
Um so f here's our agenda for today. Um we're gonna do some tool training, project plan and discuss then close. So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original, trendy and user friendly. Right. Functional design, conceptual design and detailed design. So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things.	The Project Manager discussed the goals for the project and gave an agenda for the project as a whole.
Um so we're gonna try out our white board. So you want us to draw it and then talk about it? Or just draw it? I think both. We ought to decide who starts and all that.	The group practiced using the meeting-room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard.
Um, I'm Abigail Claflin. and I guess we should all get acquainted. So this is our kick off meeting. Um Hi I'm Chiara, I'm the um Marketing Expert. I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer. I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer.	The group introduced themselves to each other.
and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in. Um, teletext is apparently outdated, so due to internet popularity, so that's off the list. Um, also our remote should be used only for television, um, Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this,	The Project Manager gave the group several new requirements for the project.
So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions. so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button? It's easy to implement. but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme, if you consider our budget, to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey. and I was thinking, I_R_ is line of sight, so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work, um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone. Yeah, so it would be a two part package. Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall We probably leave that. So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range, You don't need a light. And like if the if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light, so Then it can live anywhere. like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's	The group discussed several product features and decided that the remote will feature a locator function and will not feature speech recognition.
'Cause that that is something we have to decide, is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities. And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers, I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type, that's the the technology these days.	The group discussed whether or not the remote should control multiple devices.
Um, how do I put this So what happens it doesn't work? Could you just plug it back into hers The cable might be a little loose or something. Okay so now I need to press F_ eight, what is it? What's function?	Some of the group members had difficulties with their computers in opening their presentations.
I think still though, it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know, like 'cause if you just have like one menu button, that works like with a you know, or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_. So we definitely want a power button and numbers. That sort of like joystick flat touch thing, yeah. but do you need a screen then, do you have to have a screen then? you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then if you actually just want to zap, you can have like a thing like that, and that, and then it can just be plus and minus. Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like w right if you're on the channel let's say, then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up, and if you do that it goes down. like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just So but I'm saying like, does it make sense to have like some kind of a button, so like you're if you're on T_V_, like you can switch channels, but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks	They discussed important button functions to include and increasing usability by incorporating a scroll wheel in the design.
In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found, um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look, they don't like the way they feel, they don't think they match their operating behaviour, and an example is what we were talking about, the buttons, they only use ten per cent of the buttons, I don't know what R_S_I_ means. So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection. yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently, Channel selection, teletext, volume, and power. The other ones are the settings, and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour, and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings, about the screen, and speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that. And if we look at the market, f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds, um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product, while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent, but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um, most likely,	The Marketing Expert gave a presentation about user requirements as shown through a usability study and demonstrated that only a small number of functions on a remote were used with frequency.
and I think we should design according to these buttons.	She suggested focusing the interface design on the most frequently used functions.
This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user. And okay so basically um I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way. you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way, keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum, um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_. or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_? I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring, And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those. uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size, shapes, that sort of thing, to best fit the user.	The User Interface Designer presented some questions that should be considered in making the device user-friendly and displayed two existing remote controls for comparison.
Okay so this is on the working design, which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote, Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions, the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_. And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is. So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote, processor to take the information, and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output, like possibly a beep or a vibration. Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh, battery for the energy source, um a button pad for input, I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_, and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself.	The Industrial Designer discussed the necessary internal components and how they operated together, and presented her preferences for the type of each component to be used.
So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range,	The group decided that their target marketing group would be mostly teenagers and young professionals.
Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall We probably leave that.	There will not be a stand in which the remote is placed when not in use.
like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's Then it can live anywhere.	The group decided that the locator function eliminated the need for this component.
You don't need a light. And like if the if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light, so	The locator function will not involve an LED indicator; the remote will simply emit a sound when located.
You know actually our our new project requirements, I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things. So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next	The new requirements from the management regarding use with multiple devices were unclear.
Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire,	All participants will fill out a questionnaire after the meeting.
uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work, um yeah, so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting.	The Designers and the Marketing Expert will work on their individual presentations.
It's easy to implement. so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button? um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone. Yeah, so it would be a two part package.	A locator device separate from the remote will be incorporated into the design, which will operate with radio signal.
if you consider our budget, to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey.	Speech recognition will not be used.
So we definitely want a power button and numbers.	The main interface will include a power button.
like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just That sort of like joystick flat touch thing, yeah.	The main interface will include a scroll wheel function in place of a number pad.
But the only thing is like, iPods are so expensive, I don't think it's the wheel dealy. Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire, uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work, um yeah, so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting.	The Project Manager instructed the other participants to fill out a questionnaire and to work on their individual presentations for the next meeting.
But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda	The remote will feature a spongy material.
And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation.	The Marketing Expert will prepare a prototype evaluation.
You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit, apple machine and they have like the blueberry, like all the colours are named after fruits.	The fruits and vegetables trend will be incorporated into the design by including fruit colors along with the company colors.
Um, I'll just review what we did in our last meeting. Um, under marketing we targeted our audience, Um, then we considered some design options with how it should look,	The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting.
Um, can I do next? 'Cause I have to say something about the material and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh, fancy look and feel. Um. Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that. And th last thing is the easy to use um factor. Um, our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided, well noticed, that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend So we want to put the fashion electronics, we need to go fruit and vegetables. And also go for a spongy feel, I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go. Um. I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables, should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit?	The Marketing Expert presented current trends in the market and in fashion.
Um, our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided, well noticed, that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend So we want to put the fashion electronics, we need to go fruit and vegetables. And also go for a spongy feel, I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go. Um. I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables, should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit?	She discussed the current fruits and vegetables trend and the trend toward softer, spongier materials.
I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case. Uh we actually had an option of batteries, solar power, and um a dynamo, Oh, a dynamo is ah, it's a bicycle. It's a bicycle mechanism. Yeah, the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself. So I sort of picked battery. No. But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is, the moment you move it, it c it creates energy on its own. So if you throw it, it's gonna store loads of energy, and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying. But we need to find cost. Like the chip is probably the most expensive part.	The group also discussed energy source options and chips.
So I've been looking at the components design. Um, so we need some custom design parts, and other parts we'll just use standard. Um, I assume we'll be custom designing our case, And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board, Um, standard parts include the buttons and the wheels, um the iPod-style wheel. And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote. Um, I'd recommend against titanium Um, and the rubber case requires rubber buttons, so if we definitely want plastic buttons, we shouldn't have a rubber case. Uh, well we can use wood. I don't know why we'd want to.	The Industrial Designer gave her presentation on components and discussed which would have to be custom-made and which were standard.
Um, and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design.	The User Interface Designer will work on the interface and the Industrial Designer will work on the look and feel of the device.
Um, we can use rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button, it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip.	She also discussed the various materials and chips available.
Oh when we move on, you two are going to be playing with play-dough.	The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype.
I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on. that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out,	They discussed using the menu function on the television instead.
I mean, if you're thinking of the design of it now, like the a you know, physical attributes, I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing? So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before. Like, I think we're looking at something that could be, like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing. W when we had the wheely remote control, we it was on the top I think, if you held it like that. What if, um, you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much? um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing. and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is. And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing	The group then talked about the casing of the device, and decided that there would be a changeable outer casing.
If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand, and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is. And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. see you're thinking, it's weird, you're thinking the opposite of me Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing	The group wanted to include a changeable outer casing but could not decide whether the spongy or the hard plastic component should be the removable casing.
And then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, So I guess we have to look into the, um, like, the programming, how this how they actually programme these things, and if that's Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_? I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_, not inside the remote.	The group discussed how the menu function would be programmed.
oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there.	The remote will feature a changeable outer casing.
we're gonna try to talk about, um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control, based on fruit vegetable design. And, um, basically, so, this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system. Uh, so people are going to be looking at this little screen. I mean I assume, are we still on the screen idea? it seems like you would need a screen. But the screen can come up on the telly, the she said. Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on. I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of, you know, range we need to have on the wheel, You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal. that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ Yeah, well we don't want the screen I guess,	The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the remote with the group.
But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand, Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing	Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material.
I mean I assume, are we still on the screen idea? it seems like you would need a screen. But the screen can come up on the telly, the she said. Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if And then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal. Yeah, well we don't want the screen I guess,	They discussed including a touch-based graphical user interface but noted that it was unnecessary and costly.
You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit, apple machine and they have like the blueberry, like all the colours are named after fruits. And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing So where are the fruit and vegetables now? I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front, or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath.	They discussed including fruit colors in addition to the company colors.
But we need to find cost. Does anyone have costs on the on the web? All it said was it gave sort of relative, some chips are more expensive than others, sort of things. It didn't give me any actual cost.	There was a lack of information on the cost of several components.
What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say,	The group decided that the fruit and vegetable shapes of the device were uncomfortable to hold.
Okay we have to fill in all this stuff. So I guess we're supposed to write final reports.	All participants will write a final report.
So I guess we're supposed to write final reports. All of us? I don't know. Hmm. Hmm. Or is that just me?	The Project Manager instructed all participants to write a final report at the end of the meeting.
Um and the means for like the materials we used, how convenient were they? Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft, PowerPoint or any of this stuff. but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like it was kinda like okay, I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here. and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations, My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works. 'Cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff Yeah well mine was mostly made up But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um	They complained that the meeting-room materials were difficult to use, and some complained that there was not enough information provided to them.
The prototype making was very creatively stimulating It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute. Um yeah, I thought we all worked very well together.	They felt they worked well together and were creative.
I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of I felt like I was off-task all the time. What do you guys think of the pens? They're kinda hard to write with though.	The group discussed their experience on the project.
but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like it was kinda like okay, I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here. and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations, My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works. 'Cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff Yeah well mine was mostly made up But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um	Some participants complained that there was not enough information provided to them.
So our design looks something like this. This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever. And uh the base of the remote control, which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel, is interchangeable. So you can change the colour, according to your to suit your living room or whatever. You could change the vegetable, or fruit. it's trendy fruit, it's not just ordinary fruits. And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them, because they'll need to switch 'em out. It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable,	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed the changeable fruit- and vegetable-shaped covers.
Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that. Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary.	The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting.
Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft, PowerPoint or any of this stuff.	They complained that the meeting-room equipment was difficult to use.
What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say,	The group felt that the fruit and vegetable shapes of the remote were uncomfortable to hold.
and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria. 'Cause I mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory, it fits the budget, and it's trendy.	The group decided that the final production cost and all of the other initial goals were met sufficiently to be able to continue with the project.
we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber. and just have the colour match or something. We could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits. And you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part. I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too.	They decided to produce the device in one uniform shape, with changeable covers in fruit colors and designs.

I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say,	The group felt that the changeable fruit and vegetable shapes were uncomfortable to hold.
I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four, where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote. Well the worst ones were three point one. Material technologically innovative, Batteries easy to insert for some reason, I think that's not a problem any more. You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes, It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape.	The group discussed the areas in which the prototype did not meet these goals.
And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria. I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. Um we can do it separately and then discuss it We'll just go in a circle. Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? So it's a one was true and seven was false? Oh I thought it was the other way round. I thought it was the other way round too.	Each participant rated the prototype according to the original criteria for the project.
Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start. And we we have therefore in total um We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated. True is one and and false is seven. I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. it's if it's fancy you put one, if it's really unfancy it's seven. Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard. um is it necessary? I don't think so. We'll just go in a circle. Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone.	The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype.
Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder, there's an Excel spreadsheet. Um the only one that's in there, production costs. But if I missed anything that we've gone over, or if you see something that has changed I said uncurved or flat. My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes. There's plastic for that area around the button. Um and lots of special colours actually. Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine, which is even less than twelve point five, which means we'd be making even more of a profit.	The Project Manager discussed the final production cost for the device, which totaled 11.9 Euros.
Well the locator is just chip that's inside there. And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed. Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset.	They discussed the locator function that will be designed at a later time.
I think we've got um a good idea now. Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly. we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail. Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised.	The project manager closes the meeting.
and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um,	The product will be sold for twenty five Euro.
we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros	The company should profit fifty million Euros overall.
and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um, we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent. It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make.	The project manager tells them the project budget.
It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make.	The production cost should be twelve Euros fifty.
would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls. I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well. Um, but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use, Or anybody else, strong feelings about remote controls? Um I think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself Think a lot of the time, remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players, like they aren't they're very boring, making a a stylish remote control would be a very like Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition. Um. Something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control. I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control, people won't see it as a remote control I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big, rectangular things so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better. that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see, like a mouse button. remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it whereas if you want could all be flat I mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh fi find the button buttons easily. But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down must admit	They proceed to discuss problems with current remotes as well as preferable styles and looks, such as using face-plates so the look is changable.
w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control. taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody, uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company. um I'll just go round th the table, Andrew, marketing, um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design. Um. ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want, uh everybody has a contribution to make	The project manager opens the meeting by welcoming everybody and saying they will be developing a new television remote control.
The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design, uh what it uh what it must actually do, the uh conceptual design, uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production.	The further work will be on the functional, conceptual, and detailed design.
Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here, um In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires, that we don't do that, um everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal, but le let's go round the table, Um, badger. Um probably a duck Uh 's horses, I think homo sapien	Since they all know what a whiteboard is, they do a virtual drawing by each stating their favorite animal.
if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly my name's Andrew I'm a I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design, what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view. I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before Uh I'm Katie, I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control	Then each group member states his/her name and role in the group.
um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do. The the remote control needs to be original, there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have um and that goes along with being trendy, uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario. User-friendly as as we all know, remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly And last but not least, or indeed first of all, it it must make the company money,	The project manager states that the remote needs to be original, trendy, and user-friendly.
the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet.	Teletext no longer important given rise of internet and thus will not be used.
We're looking at extreme simplicity. We're looking at a radically different shape. Possibly no buttons at all um, but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design, then then that's fine. Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control, volume control and on off. and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers. Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo, uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme Yeah. We are doing just the television. are we doing just the television so not D_V_D_ players, I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given, we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting,	They briefly review their discussions and close the meeting.
I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one. Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls, particularly sort of independent ones. you know, the number of things you buy these days, which you know, have a a a lithium whatever battery in, Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control, the the the battery will last know, five, ten years. uh uh p perhaps we should, know, reduce the uh, you know, the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years? it's actually a marketing gimmick. it's uh it's totally practical. Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by, you know, magnetic waves or whatever, It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time. I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there, 'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies. what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery? Uh. That sounds pretty good, yeah. Do they make batteries that last that long? but there are certainly things that you buy. I mean calculators for example. Yeah, they have that little solar Most of them, don't they have sort of a combination of the two, when there is light, they'll work off the light, and if there isn't, they'll kick into this battery, so we can maybe do something like that I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating I would think is i is is probably, you know, no more than minutes in its entire life. like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used	The group discusses using a battery that will last 5-10 years or a solar combined with a battery.
I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh. Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system, the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever. Um and it does this uh by well, you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television, the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do. Um and you need a user interface, which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it. Um Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source, uh some sort of user interface, which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that. Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver. This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for. my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out, uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in, so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you. Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it,	Next the industrial designer presents, explaining how a remote control works and giving personal preference to a remote which has a large energy source such as a rechargable battery or battery dock.
this is just about the technical functions. the method, I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas Um and then there are two different kinds that I found. There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one these are the two different ones. This one um this is the user centred, it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred, which has a lot more buttons, what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set, turn on, off, switch the channels and the volume and things such as that. And so for this product it's gonna be television only, and then it has to have the uh logos for my personal preferences, I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know, fewer buttons. Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top, then that would be easier. the unique style, maybe have it light up um the changeable face-plates, maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that, when we were talking about havi losing it,	The interface specialist presents, showing examples of two different products- one that is user-centered and another that is engineering-centered and giving personal preference to the simpler one because it is easier to use and has fewer buttons.
Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours.	Device will incorporate company logo and colors.
Um and and they want it only to cover televisions.	The remote will be for television only.
rather than the uh the the traditional Um something like this shape, sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape, uh uh uh l uh l such as I mean um something you hold up like that, We're looking at a radically different shape.	The remote will be a radiaclly different shape.
Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly, We're looking at extreme simplicity.	The remote will be extremely simple.
I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use. Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something. So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings, And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use? you could have the most used buttons on top like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath. If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether. I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition, what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups. Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group, uh to put myself right in the middle of it, um u use remote controls to a great extent. again, we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups. If we wanted something different, truly different, then the buttonless remote control w would be it. the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls. But if you just lift it up and say, channel one or B_B_C_ You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are, I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the, you know, the sound from the television, because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh, you know, I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself, so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use. w we need to s identify things that people actually need and	They discuss the possibility of making a remote that hides less frequently used buttons, one that uses voices recognition to eliminate buttons altogether, or one that combines the two functions.
these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab. Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see. Um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff. And general opinions about current current remotes. See that, as we kinda noticed, seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly. Uh along with um looking less ugly, if it looks better, eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it. Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user. I kinda take that to mean as um they they don't uh they, yeah, they only use they only work for the television as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system, a digital box, a D_V_D_ player, a video player and T_V_. Uh again, seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot. fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons, we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext, but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used So I think maybe fewer buttons, which also make the design look sleeker, frustrations of like people losing remote control. maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ it would have to incorporate, but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control. Maybe like it'll beep or something. the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is And uh repetitive strain injury, I suppose we should make it more comfortable like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable. Maybe don't even have to hold it as such. It also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech	The marketing expert presents, talking about user functionality requirements taken from research of 100 people.
I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations. Uh before I do that, however, I will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought. the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet. Um and and they want it only to cover televisions. what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover, you know, videos, D_V_D_s, um satellite boxes, which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise. The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only. Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours. Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there, the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background. this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market. Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly, but uh um we we need to talk that through.	He tells them some new project requirements given by management.
welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group. Um I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour. Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items, that switching was easy, that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular, um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting, that the keys might be concave, Um should have interchangeable fascias um illuminated Um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls. And that it shouldn't be too small, mm that it it gets lost. Um.	The project manager opens the meeting by going through notes from the last meeting, recapping the topics covered.
I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the, you know, the sound from the television, the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls. I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition, because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh, you know, I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself, so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use. Uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition	Whether to use voice recognition.
S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um and has quite a you know, fewer buttons. if minimum number of buttons is our priority, then we should, as I say, r know, really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum, possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off. Um and nothing else. but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design, then then that's fine.	The remote will have few buttons, but the main ones such as channel, volume, on/off.
and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers. um the changeable face-plates,	Whether to use changable covers.
the the the battery will last Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control, know, five, ten years. Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by, you know, magnetic waves or whatever, It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time. I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there, what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery? Uh. That sounds pretty good, yeah. Do they make batteries that last that long? but there are certainly things that you buy. I mean calculators for example. Yeah, they have that little solar Most of them, don't they have sort of a combination of the two, when there is light, they'll work off the light, and if there isn't, they'll kick into this battery, so we can maybe do something like that	What type of battery to use - long-lasting ordinary battery or solar + regular battery.
and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years	The remote will have a long-term battery source.
And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at. Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough, Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete,	The interface designer and industrial specialist will be producing a model of the product
Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it	The industrial specialist will be looking at how the user uses the product.
and uh whatever happens next year, we can have the face plates, With interchangeable covers, could just buy a new one every year, a new one when new fashions come out. depending on the cost of the product itself, you know, could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed? Instead of having a ten year guarantee? What if we included the batteries in the cover? Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better. I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one, That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all, you know, completely soldered together I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection um and, you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing, the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all, it will still work um totally. that that's just it with the covers, you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product. Um and, you know, as as external fashions change, then we get new new covers on the market and, you know, readily available. I i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept. Um it it should be cheap, you know, if if we avoid any, you know, electrical connections. i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want, then uh I mean uh uh this is totally new.	Whether to use changable face plates.
Uh and then uh, you know, f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look, feel and design,	The interface designer will be looking at the look, feel, and design.
inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive. And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip. a lot longer than an off the shelf chip. maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost.	However, a custom design chip is more expensive and would take longer than using an existing chip.
and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation. and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control.	The marketing expert will be doing the product evaulation.
and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip. given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before, uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons,	To add voice option, likely need to design own chip.
Um it it should be cheap, you know, if if we avoid any, you know, electrical connections.	If used, face plates will be cheap.
And you know, th the the design that I've got, and and it could be a a home-made design, um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control, the fashions apply to furniture, It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me. I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably, two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else, um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing. And, know whether we go down the fruit and veg route, and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana, but um know sort of the the organic, you know, curved look, t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know, the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and, you know, whether whether the you know, the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow. Um 'cause there's certainly you know, the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow yellow seems a bit of a strong colour I mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um. I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse. because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it. you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it, you want something you can definitely grip. so it's you sorta hold	They discuss what the remote should look like in terms of shape color, and then talk about components, materials, and energy sources.
I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um. Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough, Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete, and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control. we're all clear where we go from here. thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes.	Then they close the meeting.
But the television would be the display We actually use the television, okay. Okay, okay, okay.	No display screen.
so I did some research on the internet the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users, um commands and mechanisms for the operation, and there're just kind of a variety of choices. Um findings, a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual. There're some special ones available, like this one right here, which is marketed towards children, um different designs, and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like.	The interface specialist present research from the internet about user interface.
We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume.	Will have menu, channel, power, volume buttons.
just kind of minimise the clutter, avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button, like you have on a mouse, that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume, for example, have the slide button on the side, I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple, cheap and reliable. I think they're they're about the same cost really. there's a lot of slide buttons out there. Okay, fair enough, fine. for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down So three three there's three buttons on a slider. The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons, like the buttons on one side for the channel, and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand, and you pick it up, it's easy to n s know, okay, this is just the volume and this is the channel. 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume, or vice versa, so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different. like the shape of it almost like a mouse, so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change I was thinking kind of just for the volume, in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling,	He talks about minimizing the clutter on the remote, and suggests using a slide button like on a mouse.
I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes. we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff, but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice. you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons.	Will have voice with fewer buttons.
this is my report on trend watching. The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer. And we got reports from Paris, Milan on new fashions. And uh the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy, look and feel uh instead of the current functional look and feel. I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect, which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it. and the third being easy to use is probably a given, I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those. from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes, et cetera. clothes, shoes and furniture and uh a spongy material to be used on the on the outside. that's different, certainly. if we're going for the it looks fancy, then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through. But fashions do don't last very long. that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things, like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year, we can have the face plates, we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it Also means you can drop it without damaging it. depending on the cost of the product itself, you know, could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed? Instead of having a ten year guarantee? With interchangeable covers, could just buy a new one every year, a new one when new fashions come out. it's like the old Swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those, 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion, I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last, you know, a long time.	The marketing expert presents, talking about trend-watching and how fruits and vegetables are currently an important theme.
I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse. you'd want it narrower than a mouse though	Will be curved, shape similar to a computer mouse, but narrower.
and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility	The remote will contain a custom chip.
What if we included the batteries in the cover? Oh yeah. I like that. Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better. I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one, That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all, you know, completely soldered together um and, you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing, the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all, it will still work um totally. Um then if, you know, if people lose the cover, I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote. that that's just it with the covers, you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product. it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item. Um and, you know, as as external fashions change, then we get new new covers on the market and, you know, readily available. like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours.	They talk about making changable colors available and possibly including batteries with them.
Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group. Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting. Um the the the problem with existing remote controls, we felt, was that they're ugly Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use Um and people lose them. um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons, and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use. um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery and a shape that will be instantly recognisable, A_ um as uh a trendy remote control, and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product. again um, I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision. Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today, finally, are um what energy source we want to use, And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply, then basically it's uh sealed for life um and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice um d d do we go for a custom designed chip? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves? we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today. Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface, Uh and then uh, you know, f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look, feel and design, Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation. And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a	The project manager opens the meeting by recapping the discussions of the previous meeting, telling the group this meeting's agenda, and stating what each person will do for the next meeting.
I'll just be talking about the components design. basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do. Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_. Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator, uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor. Um. Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format. This signal's sent to the transistor and then sends it on to the light emitting diode which is then trai changed into a infrared light as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons. Uh y the fewer buttons you have, I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need. Um however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult Also we have to work within the company constraints, and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it.	Then the industrial designer talks about the components design and explains exactly what remotes do and how they operate.
Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator, uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor. Um. Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format. This signal's sent to the transistor and then sends it on to the light emitting diode which is then trai changed into a infrared light Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use, so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years Um we also need to look at the chips, uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf, and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon. Um, however that's gonna cost more, but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper but it's going to be less flexible with the features, especially things like uh voice activation, so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip. inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive. Do we do we know uh by how much? I don't actually have any price information, And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip. a lot longer than an off the shelf chip. I think we need to make a a decision here. Uh given that the company wants this	He also talks about batteries and chips.
Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read, um the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh uh just tidy up with production	The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda.
we basically have the same kinda lay-out here you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand, basically. Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume, on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll, or you can hold it and and push. Uh this is the power key, um it's kinda like the biggest Uh that's the little menu key. This is the infra-red section Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that Um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through. Um. for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically we could broaden the broaden it out a bit but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand The final product would actually stand up, yeah. I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on	Then the industrial designer and interface specialist present the prototype, showing where they placed each button, function, and the company logo.
And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic, just kind of a light non-descript grey and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers, so they kinda just stretch over. spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers and then the buttons come through each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_.	Then they talk about the material they chose, which is light gray colored and light weight plastic so that people will want to buy covers.
let's have a look at the um f finance. if I get the uh spreadsheet up. this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us, for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours, then that is not a special colour, we're just simply on batteries, the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around that I don't think is a a serious problem. The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay. Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um slider I do don't know that they're special colour. Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves	Next they take a brief look at the finance by examining the materials used, chip required, shape, and color.
the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give, I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget. Um.	They are exactly on target at twelve point five.
Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve, from the point of view of the the consumer and the management. what I've been asked to do is, on the whiteboard um gauge our team response to these questions. on a scale of one to seven, one being true and seven being being false. And then at the end just take an average look at these questions. Is the device f flashy and fashionable? I think most definitely. I'd say definitely a one yeah. and also uh technologically innovative? Yeah, defi yeah, yeah the voice technology indeed. Easy to use? I don't see we could've made it any easier. Uh suitable for the consumer? Yeah definitely. I think it made we met all of the consumer Uh is it complicated? No. Uh functional? Yeah definitely. found easily. We've b built in the the speech, where are you, function. Does it take long to learn to use? No, not at all. The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards, Less buttons it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well. Um will device appeal to all age groups? I think it will because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality, the e ease of use of the device might make up for that. I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups I think we can reasonably say it's another another one, in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement it's it's simple to use, um it's it's it's within budget, I I think we've done an amazing job one	Next the marketing expert administers the product evaluation, and the group talks about whether the device is flashy and fashionable, technologically innovative, easy to use, suitable for the consumer, complicated, how long it would take to learn to use it, and its appeal to all age groups.
Eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one.	They come up with an average of 1 for the evaluation.
I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity, seemed to discuss things pretty well I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows. Um I won't comment on leadership, uh teamwork I think we've uh I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together. Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens, and new ideas found, um, again gi no given relatively everyday product, I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh uh a new approach. Um are the costs within budget? Yes. Is the project evaluated? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria, um	They briefly discuss the project process and agree that they worked well together, had excellent teamwork, and created an effective product that meets the budget cost.
Thank you very much indeed, Cool, thank you, So I call the meeting closed.	They close the meeting by thanking one another.
And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic, just kind of a light non-descript grey	The remote will be made of light weight plastic, and a light gray color.
and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers, so they kinda just stretch over.	The changeable colors will be made of ipod cover materials, a rubbery, spongy, stretchy material.
Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands Uh this is the power key, Uh that's the little menu key. Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume, on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda	The remote will have volume slider, channel buttons, power key, menu key, infared section, microphone for voice commands.
Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves	Double curved shape.
the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget. Um. that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give,	The group is exactly on budget, not including the interchangable covers which they have not calcuated in.
I was just wondering if that's the um If fifty percent is normal Um I would think would be more like sixty percent.	Whether the mark-up reflected in the selling price is normal.
Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day. Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction. As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting, um become acquainted with each other, um have a little training on tools, uh create a plan, discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total. The new remote control is to be original, trendy and user-friendly. That, Steph, is your part, is the user-friendliness. The originality um is gonna take all of us. Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you, Sarah. we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design.	The project manager opened the meeting by stating the agenda and then introduced the upcoming project to the team members.
we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros, Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item.	The project manager briefed the team on the production and selling costs of the remote they are to create.
Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item.	Production costs cannot exceed 12.50 Euro.
Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard. Kate, why don't you try it first, if you can either bring your things with you, I guess we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well, 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around. you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal. Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat. I think it's to get us used to using the pen. Not a mouse, a rat. a fish. And I think your pen's running out of whatever.	The team members then participated in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and discussed why they liked the particular animal.
Experience with a remote control. Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something? That that that's the sorta product we're talking about, one that will work for a in a home environment, for a T_V_s and I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time, but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another. that you always sit around you know, you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something, there's five different remotes, and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else. And they don't always talk to each other. But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television. We could make a Hello Kitty themed remote. I think one in b bright colours would be good. I think one that works would be good. We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation. I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products. I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions. Like I've got one at home that has well, apart from the obvious, channels, channel up, channel down, volume, you know, subtitles, mute, there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do, like. that's a really good point, because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate, we tend to um go to menus and then make choices, so if it's like an uh volume button, you know, you can go in and say mute or or volume. We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down. Mm. We can make it smart like an iPod, make everything menus.	The team then discussed their experiences using remote controls and what features in terms of functionality and appearance to consider in making the remote.
with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros. That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale. would be like what, a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million. if they cost twelve and a half, you're selling it for twenty five, you're making twelve and a half Euros each. Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million, I was just wondering if that's the um If fifty percent is normal Um I would think would be more like sixty percent. you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that. In order to make fifty million Euros, and you're only getting twelve and a half each four million. You'd have to sell four million.	The project manager also briefed the team on the profit aim and discussed how many remotes must be sold in order to reach the profit aim of 50 million Euro.
and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros,	The remote will be sold for 25 Euro.
Our functions, we've so far decided, I think, that power, channel, volume make it attractive.	The remote will have functions for power, channels, and volume.
so that we'd be looking for the younger end.	The user target group will be younger consumers.
It has to have big user-friendly buttons	The remote will have large buttons.
Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys.	The remote will have an enter button and number buttons.
Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements?	How much the components inside a remote cost.
In real numbers, does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million? Um, I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that, if you're asking me, but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there, or are they making purchasing decisions? are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls? Bu but what I was gonna say was, although they they may be buying um, you know, personal music devices and all that,	Whether the intended target group will result in the sale of at least 4 million remotes.
it's better than my idea about solar, probably. solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night, It would have to sor store up the energy M yeah, that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much.	Whether to use solar power.
for you, Steph, to do the user interface	The user interface designer will work on the user interface.
um that teletext is outdated um	The team will not work with teletext.
or are they making purchasing decisions? Bu but what I was gonna say was, although they they may be buying um, you know, personal music devices and all that, are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls?	Whether younger consumers are actually buying remote controls.
Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components,	The industrial designer will work on the components.
which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger, then you then it has a place. But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not. I uh think that's a very interesting idea, and I don't know much about what these things cost. but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install, do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop? Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range.	The cost of a rechargeable base.
Are we agreed as to what our target group is though? so that we'd be looking for the younger end. but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there, or are they making purchasing decisions? Bu but what I was gonna say was, although they they may be buying um, you know, personal music devices and all that, are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls? It might be good to know um uh who, you know, who's actually buying televisions Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it. That's probably more what it is. We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day, Our functions, we've so far decided, I think, that power, channel, volume make it attractive. Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions. It has to have big user-friendly buttons Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys. and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful. my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining. Enter, power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key. H how does that work? how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter? if you're pressing enter, the the thing would already be on, and so maybe um when you press power, initially it turns it on, press power again and use that as an enter um Then you'd have to have an off te off key. I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession, It's not getting a bit complicated? Or something that has a a turning dial, where at the far end is on or off	Th team then discussed their user target group, marketing ideas such as selling the remote to television manufacturers, and what functions the remote would feature.
and for you the trend-watching.	The marketing expert will work on trend watching
um with incorporating the corporate image, colour and slogan.	The team must incorporate the corporate image, color, and slogan in the design of the remote.
Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is, you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries Could it be possible to have uh, you know, like a rechargeable internal battery, like, well, like an M_P_ three player does? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever. You could you know, you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours, and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages, and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries, which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger, then you then it has a place. And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa. But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not. I uh think that's a very interesting idea, and I don't know much about what these things cost. it's better than my idea about solar, probably. solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night, It would have to sor store up the energy M yeah, that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much. but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install, do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop? And the dock could look very fancy Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in. Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range.	The team also discussed options for energy sources, such as solar power and rechargeable internal batteries.
but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_	The remote will only be for televisions.
I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work. I've been doing a little bit of web-based research, But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you. let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is. It's for sending a message, um typically um via infrared. And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source, the user interface which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses, we turn that into a message, um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver. we want an energy source And we've got to think about what that might be. Uh typically it would be a battery, but I'm open to suggestions. then we have the the user interface. And the main components in there are the the th the chip that translates button presses into a message, and sends the message to the receiver. what what does it look like? What do the buttons look like? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own. The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there, or um what if the chip, for whatever reason, breaks down after a certain amount of time, do you just replace it? Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others, in a different frequency or something? but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device. I may be wrong here, Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing, I like the idea of speech recognition, that's a great idea, but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit. Do we have um ki	The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and addressed the issue of what happens when remotes no longer operate.
my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining. Enter, power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key. H how does that work? how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter? if you're pressing enter, the the thing would already be on, and so maybe um when you press power, initially it turns it on, press power again and use that as an enter um Then you'd have to have an off te off key. I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession, It's not getting a bit complicated?	Combining the power button and enter button into one button.
technical functions design. I think first off, basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah. I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions. my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have. And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have. If we can build on this with the speech recognition, that's not something I'd thought about at all, Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control, if this is only gonna be a, you know, satellite, cable, T_V_ remote control. these are two models of existing remote controls. Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control. It has fast-forward, stop, play, all relating to movies. It also has seems to have channel up and channel down, Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right, which has it also has play, stop and pause and everything, I don't think we need them at all. I think we just need channel selection, volume up, volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext, but along the same lines, access things on the screen. Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned, because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do. I was thinking something some smooth, sleek, little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access. Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility. But we could go back to the pictures of the uh, what're they called? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them, I think the white that one on the right is, as well as less cluttered, The the style of these is	The user interface designer presented two existing remote controls on the market, which the team later evaluated, and discussed what features in terms of appearance and functionality the remote the team is creating should include.
that's looking at age groups. and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people. Or comfortable, I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist, power, channel, volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers.	The marketing expert also discussed a user target group for the remote and addressed the issue of whether the target group would result in sufficient sales of the remote.
One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device, as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you. my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now, and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard. And if we devote some energy into this, I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction, the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these, I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools. again, most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls. fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons. eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy. Could can I ask where these figures come from, Um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room, so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money. and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition. the early adopters, those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it, the young age group without the	The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of remote controls and the increasing interest among younger consumers in speech recognition.
Welcome to this second meeting. This is a meeting on functional design. Um I did took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment. Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes, I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes, um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more, maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion, because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have. for the minutes of the first meeting. the product was developed uh and reviewed, and we talked about the financial end of it. Um and it had some implications, um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons, bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese. Did I miss something? we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well. as a group I think we've are they're accepting the minutes. Um, then we'll move to the three presentations.	The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting.
I'm afraid I don't have that information available. Um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty? Um manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this, I'm afraid.	Whether creating a fancy remote would adhere to the project budget.
You were saying that the kinetic would be useful, I i in terms of workability, I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic, What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic? I've used kinetic in terms of watches you don't even notice um that it's there. I've never come across it before, but it sounds fantastic. it would make the whole thing a lot lighter, more convenient. a good selling point. So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible. But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs. Mm.	Whether to use a kinetic battery.
Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside, and then a kind of spongy Yeah, s thick spongy cover,	The case of the remote will be made of rubber.
Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside, and then a kind of spongy Yeah, s thick spongy cover,	The remote will contain a hard plastic inner shell to protect the interior.
like four buttons, up, down, left and right with enter in the middle, that will correspond to a menu on the screen. I'd like push buttons with	The remote will use push buttons.
I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy, I was thinking titanium myself. I think many of us would associate those with fancy. I have been influenced by pictures of iPods, I mean titanium would be great, And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber. but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey. we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately. If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic, then I think titanium's too futuristic. Mm. We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy	Whether to use titanium or a spongy material.
Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components, um the materials, things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things. They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use, which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery, kinetic or solar. You were saying that the kinetic would be useful, um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries. Um or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day, that it'll die on you, and no way to do it. unfortunately I don't have costing information. I i in terms of workability, I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic, What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic? I've used kinetic in terms of watches you don't even notice um that it's there. I've never come across it before, but it sounds fantastic. it would make the whole thing a lot lighter, more convenient. a good selling point. So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible. But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs. Mm. Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision. Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and I would certainly recommend it, I think, Um what about the case? I think they're talking there about do we want wood, plastic, titanium or rubber, Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside, and then a kind of spongy Yeah, s thick spongy cover, and I think we've discussed not having titanium. Um we've sort of eliminated wood. We said plastic or rubber. I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible, but I agree	The team then discussed and made decisions on what energy sources, chips, case materials, and buttons to use.
I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says, just that my method was to look at the, well, my my inspirations, which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing, including M_P_ three players, uh like you know, hi-fi remotes, not just television and these things. Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones, Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel, um what functions we actually need, but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right. It has uh scroll wheels without without a display, So I was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen. and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment, you can scroll along and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen. Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote, um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice, big, easy buttons to press, but still quite simple and quite cost effective. what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple, uh not fancy but not totally minimalist, I mean just pretty simple plastic, probably, I was thinking, yellow and black, just because that's the company's colours, with very very few buttons, but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen, like, you know, just small along the bottom Yeah, I'd I'd certainly support that idea. But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one. And I quite like it, 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in	The user interface designer examined the interfaces of existing products and discussed using menus within an interface using push buttons which operate like a scroll wheel.
And they actually want a look and feel design, user interface design, Um the look and feel design is for Kate,	The industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design.
Marketing they want product evaluation. you get product evaluation.	The marketing expert will work on a product evaluation.
What's hot, fruit and veg. Spongy. And this is all over the catwalks, Paris, Milan, and I'm talking about clothing, furniture, shoes. This is really interesting change from past years, because it is much more organic, And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control, we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset. on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing. Functional is out. Fancy. And f the fancy, and that's exactly the term, I'm I'm thinking polished, elegant, you know, kind of innovative, but a cut above. This is twice as important as the next finding, which is technologically innovative. This is interesting, 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important, but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh, you know, designed in interesting substances. Ease of use. Again, pretty low, I mean it's the top three, but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important. I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves. It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote, you know, your t your cell phone. I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned, you know, so, you know, something similar to a summer dress. you know, it would have like fruit and veg, is that we actually make these spongy. initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held, so banana, pineapple and pear. They could be interchangeable, they're spongy, So what we're talking about is changing. this concept. Everyone has a T_V_ remote, but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising, I'm thinking the teenager, the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you	The trend watching reports indicated that products need to reflect a fruit and vegetable theme, sponginess, fanciness, and technological innovation.
first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up, which was uh current cost of the competition devices, and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros, depending on uh branding. But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for, we're well within, even on the lower end, of the uh of the market. I investigated the remote control market in greater detail, and my uh the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch. What's hot, fruit and veg. Spongy. And this is all over the catwalks, Paris, Milan, and I'm talking about clothing, furniture, shoes. This is really interesting change from past years, because it is much more organic, And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control, we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset. on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing.

And they actually want a look and feel design, user interface design, uh Steph gets the user interface design,	The user interface designer will work on the user interface design.
you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you, I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate, and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division, who have told me what's actually available, you know, what the current state of the art in components is, and some of the exciting new things they've got, this is the innards of a remote control um. and that's the the back of the interface. And this is a push-button one, so you see these little little buttons here, they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here. that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate. We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver. So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source. Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment. We can have a hand a wind-up, yeah, but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg. Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source, where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device, Or we we had talked about solar power, but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark. I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case. It can be made of plastic, rubber, wood o if you like, or titanium. Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber, and basically it can have a flat surface, a curved surface or a double curved surface, but I think if we wanna use standard components, we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that. what does the interface look like	The industrial designer discussed options for energy sources, materials, case shapes, and interface components such as buttons and LCD screens.
Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype.	Two of the team members will create a prototype using modeling clay
I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this. Spongy is gonna be difficult, I'm afraid. And as for as for um well budgeting as well, if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components. we can make these things out of wood, titanium, plastic or rubber. I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy, I was thinking titanium myself. I have been influenced by pictures of iPods, I think many of us would associate those with fancy. it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable. So Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit, I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next. I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone.	The team then discussed their target group and whether to use titanium or a spongy material in their design.
So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible.	The remote will use a kinetic battery.
this is the beginning of the third meeting, the conceptual design meeting. Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting, the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point. Um and we should each have a presentation to make. Um we have certain decisions to make Um there are the decisions we have to turn to, but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting. Um Sarah, you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held, power, channel, volume, number keys, possibly a speech recognition. And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use. Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device, because of the twelve and a half Pence cost. Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point. we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense, that were decision makers. Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_, Um and that the function we agreed was volume, power, numbers, enter, channels, a way to move between channels, easy to use and hand-held. Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition, what what do the current ones sell for. Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics. Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed.	The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting.
There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight. It looks like it single curve, What does double curved mean, I don't understand. you can do a banana in single curve,	Whether to create a single-curved or double-curved remote.
And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary,	The team will work on a meeting summary.
So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana, you know, with the grooves and the stalk and stuff, I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana. And of the two I really like I m I like the banana, that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now, I think between the two, somewhere between the two is true.	Whether to select a banana shaped remote or a chunky remote.
And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary,	The team will work on a final questionnaire.
Yeah. They could be plastic, we don't have to have rubber buttons,	The buttons on the remote will be made of plastic.
go to the project evaluation, next slide. the project process, satisfaction with, for example, the room for creativity. leadership, Sure. teamwork, Yes. means, of having whiteboard, the digital pens and all that kind of good things. Yeah, yeah, the Play-Doh was best, I thought. 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying, well we quite want this, but imagine it rounder. and we're satisfied with all the above. we went over all those things Um did we find any new ideas? I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes. Spongy. And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before, Good work as a design team, I'm not sure all the wires are really great though.	The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process, in which they indicated that they were quite happy with the tools available to them, the ideas they came up with, and their teamwork.
Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed. More profit.	The cost to produce the remote was 9.20 pounds and did not exceed the project budget.
and the next big thing is the finance. And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device. Hand dynamo, battery, kinetic, solar cells. just kinetic then,. Electronic simple chip on print, and we'll need one of those. 'cause we've just got push buttons, and we only need one of those. the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve. It looks like it single curve, What does double curved mean, I don't understand. I I think you it means you reverse the curve. you can do a banana in single curve, case material supplements. Plastic, wood, rubber, titanium, special colour. I just wanna say plastic. I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself, Okay. We'll come back, if we can, to the rubber being added And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of, rubber? does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material? Button supplements, they'll be in a special colour of black. 'Cause I think they can be plastic. Yeah. They could be plastic, we don't have to have rubber buttons, We had the special colour.	The project manager then examined the production costs of the remote.
Um we're down to the prototype presentation. well you see, each made one, This is the one that I made. It is uh curved, easy to hold, hand-held, nice and small with big easy buttons. This is like a scroll, but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus. And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there. the function of these buttons is up, down, left and right in the different menus. The main feature of it is just a simple design, simple, lack of uh buttons all over the place. Form curved, kind of smooth, hand-held, but I think we have two different options, Uh material, I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit, because we did make a another one, which wa uh is in the shape of banana, if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons, like just like this but in the shape of a banana, which is also nice and easy to hold and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology, just a slightly different design. uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic. Whereas otherwise we'd thought, like with this one uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons. we have the two options we can follow, either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber, depending on cost restraints. colour, I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons, but if anybody's got any other suggestions, I'm quite willing to consider them as well. maybe, Kate, you better say what you think about them. I don't have very much to add. The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic. We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two, We have simple rubber push buttons I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme, I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped. This one has no obvious connections to fruit, it kinda makes you think sort of organic, touchy-feely, kiddie, you'd expect it to be like a child's	The user interface designer and industrial designer then presented two prototypes of the remote the team is working on and discussed the options for components and materials to include in their design.
Button supplements, they'll be in a special colour of black.	The buttons on the remote will be black.
Our agenda is, as before, for me to open the meeting, for us to go over the previous minutes, then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria. We then have a finance aspect, And I know what you're all thinking of, oh my, um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in, including the production evaluation. So we're going to make a very fast track. um each of you made your presentations. Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations. The market trend of fruit and veg, mm spongy, uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy. Um we decided chip on print would be used. Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing, I think was the consensus, powered by kinetic energy. There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight. Um looking like a scroll, but it's really a push button technology, excuse my spelling um that was actually in use, Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo, a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us. and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints	The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting.
I just wanna say plastic.	The remote will be made of plastic.
We had the special colour.	The remote will be in a special color.
It looks like it single curve, you can do a banana in single curve,	The remote case will be single-curved.
'cause we've just got push buttons,	The remote will use push buttons.
I can give you a number, the average evaluation score is one point eight eight, There were six true or ones, two s almost true or close to true, and then uh one false, seven points, And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology, which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works,	Overall, the prototypes performed quite well in the evaluation.
This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation, this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise. I'm going to go and use the whiteboard, and I've made a list of criteria to look at, but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false, going over these different criteria, fancy, technologically innovative, easy to use, trendy, buttons, excess buttons, good buttons, ugly, sellable, and other. And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms, some of them seem rather close, what about price, is that gonna go on there as well? Price of materials. We'll put price up at the top. Not that we actually know anything about it, wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy? It depends what what you mean by fancy really, I'd call these quite uh minimalist, a plain, simple, clean design. it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality, I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy, like stylish or aesthetic. in terms of elegant, fancy. we'll call it E_F_ um, do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow? they're both yellow with black buttons, but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black. So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana, you know, with the grooves and the stalk and stuff, I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana. And of the two I really like I m I like the banana, that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now, I think between the two, somewhere between the two is true. It's more true than	The marketing expert then led the team in conducting a product evaluation of the prototypes in which the prototypes were evaluated on the basis of their fanciness, technological innovation, ease of use, trendiness, and marketability.
Electronic simple chip on print, and we'll need one of those.	The remote will use an electronic simple chip on print.
because we did make a another one, which wa uh is in the shape of banana, if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons, like just like this but in the shape of a banana, which is also nice and easy to hold and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology, just a slightly different design. uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic. I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme, I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped.	The second prototype was shaped like a banana and used scroll push button technology.
it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy. just kinetic then,.	The remote will use a kinetic battery.
This is the one that I made. This is like a scroll, but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus. And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there. the function of these buttons is up, down, left and right in the different menus. The main feature of it is just a simple design, simple, lack of uh buttons all over the place. Form curved, kind of smooth, hand-held, Whereas otherwise we'd thought, like with this one uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons. This one has no obvious connections to fruit, it kinda makes you think sort of organic, touchy-feely, kiddie, you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one, I could see this thing, unless it's reinforced, having a problem with the Breaking, that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it,	The first prototype featured a simple design with only a small number of buttons.
I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself, And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of, rubber? Yeah. They could be plastic, we don't have to have rubber buttons,	Whether to have rubber or plastic buttons.
I have a final report to present,	The project manager will work on a final report
I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for. Is this a mun multi-functional one I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control, so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise. That's true, But at this point in time I think you're right that uh shall we make it just a T_V_.	The group discussed the function of the prototype and decided that they should restrict the remote to television for the time being instead of allowing it to control multiple devices.
Marketing, the user requirement specification.	The Marketing Expert will prepare the user requirement specification.
Work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price. So we're looking to sell internationally, not just in Europe. We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit. And therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit. And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time.	The Project Manager discussed the projected production cost and price point for the device.
So we've got tool training. Try out whiteboard. Right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there. I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works. Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever. I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat. Um and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear Um I'm gonna go for the dog, So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw.	The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard.
Right, so agenda of the first meeting. Where we uh We have twenty five minutes for this meeting. So does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required? so tool training. Project plan. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training. Neither am I. So we have the project team, which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device. And uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one, and to to be trendier, to be with it, and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience. method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh the functional design, the conceptional design, and the detailed design in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves, the designers of this uh this device. And uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before.	The Project Manager introduced the project aim and agenda to the group.
We uh are to get acquainted. So does everyone want to say who they are? I'm Robin. I'm the Marketing Manager. I'm Louisa. I'm the User Interface Designer. I'm Nick. I am the Industrial Designer. And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader.	The group introduced themselves and their roles to each other.
Okay, so we've got um the working design for I_D_.	The Industrial Deigner will prepare the working design.
I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for. Is this a mun multi-functional one I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control, so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise. That's true, 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going. But at this point in time I think you're right that uh shall we make it just a T_V_.	The group discussed the function of the prototype and decided that they should restrict the remote to television for the time being.
Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach. Okay, so we've got um the working design for I_D_. For U_I_D_ the technical functions design. Marketing, the user requirement specification.	The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to prepare the working design, the User Interface Designer to research technical functions, and the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification.
Experience with remote control, first ideas. New remote. So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time So uh any any thoughts? Um I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons. Okay, so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily. Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible. Because a lot of um systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now, Is this just a television remote? or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined. And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house. So if you've got a combined system, it could be a combined remote. basically I'll get back to you on that. Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well. Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing? 'cause as you rightly said, there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room. So a device for for all remotes. And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room. we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room. Comes to your whistle. That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television, but Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote. I mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are, You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well, Whilst at the same time you want, as	The group began a discussion about their own experiences with using remote controls and about usability features to be included in the design.
For U_I_D_ the technical functions design.	The User Interface Designer will research technical functions.
Well, if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well, have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down, so there's kind of um everything else revealed? So you don't use it that much, That is that is a good idea actually. So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back. And that'll be better for the older generation as well So um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well. The detailed ones would be sort of brightness, And then at the back? You've got brightness and contrast. Maybe if we're gonna run out of time, one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be. Uh there's audio functions. You're also gonna have the channel tuner, as it were. And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know, saying that you want that particular thing tuned in.	Complicated functions will be hidden in a back panel.
Well shall we look into that and just get back together.	All participants will continue working on the remote functions.
Well, so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do, clapping, I think clapping,	The remote will feature a locator function that responds to clapping.
and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers.	There will be a device that allows the user to enter two numbers separately to get a two-digit number in order to reduce the overall number of buttons.
So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back.	The remote will feature a panel that hides complicated functions on the back of the device.
The detailed ones would be sort of brightness, So on front, about the number. Um the volume up and down. A mute button as well. And probably a power one as well. So so are you having the stand-by on the front, then? Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons? Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick, so. volume is twelve, Numbers is ten, And a mute, yeah. And then at the back? You've got brightness and contrast. Uh there's audio functions. You're also gonna have the channel tuner, as it were. And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know, saying that you want that particular thing tuned in.	Buttons to adjust picture quality, channel tuning, and other settings will be hidden in this panel; the number pad, the channel- and volume-changing and power buttons will remain on the main interface.
So anything that uh is to be added, such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out. because time to market is is critical. S But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras. Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible.	The group had difficulties finding a balance between adding more features and finishing the project quickly.
so we've got new project requirements. So basically we've got three things, and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options. W I I got um or or three things basically, um relating to the remote being only for T_V_. We discussed that last time Um we've got uh teletext outdated. Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing. So I I got that in email form.	The Project Manager gave the group new requirements on product features.
Um so having researched the existing models within the market, um I found my research off the internet. Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function, actually are. And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply. Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things. And then the sender, which um is usually, I've found, an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television. a power supply we then have a particular button, that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons. after you press that that sends the message to the chip, and then sends the appropriate message to the sender. that's the components of the remote	He presented all the necessary internal components and how they operate together.
Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design. Um I've just got three sections, first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um. And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote. Um so having researched the existing models within the market, um I found my research off the internet. Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function, actually are. And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply. We then have the user interface, which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote. Um the various functions used for changing channel, uh channel up and down, volume, things like that. Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things. And then the sender, which um is usually, I've found, an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television. Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system because that's obviously found in the television. Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working, a power supply we then have a particular button, that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons. after you press that that sends the message to the chip, and then sends the appropriate message to the sender. that's the components of the remote So this is the uh user interface. And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver. which then, and that's the that's the infra-red sender. going on to personal preferences, I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote, just because of the size. and infra-red um has been used quite successfully. Um and then	The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the working design of the device.
and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out. So anything that uh is to be added, such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical. S But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras. Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible.	The Project Manager reminded the group to limit the number of complicated features due to the project's time constraints.
Um. Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design. Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set, so that a desired function is performed. Um here are two example remotes. Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward, rewind functions, so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about. Uh but as you can see, the left remote is quite um quite busy looking, quite complicated. Um whereas the right remote is much simpler, it looks much more user friendly. Um so my personal preference would be the right remote. it's got a very limited number of buttons. So, it's got nice big buttons, Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that. So it's very very user friendly, But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan. Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme.	The User Interface Designer presented the necessary functions of the remote, then compared the interfaces of two existing remotes.
But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is. Well, so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do, Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function. I don't really know about the voice recognition thing. clapping, I think clapping, 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button, haven't we? Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number, I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers. Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in, but that again is probably an expense that you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once, So and if finally the T_V_ breaks, you get a new one, you're gonna have to be able to tune it. the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale, so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech. I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions, so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in. Would you maybe have like one menu button, then you'd use the other buttons, maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions. Yeah, 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well. Well, if we're trying to keep it slee	The group had a discussion to decide on product features.
going on to personal preferences, I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote, just because of the size. and infra-red um has been used quite successfully. Um and then the sender,	He gave his preferences on energy sources and senders.
Well, so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do, clapping, I think clapping, and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number, I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers.	They decided to include a clapping locator function and a device that allows the user to enter two numbers separately to get a two-digit number.
we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control. and um how do people use it? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them. And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers. And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control, the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings, um they weren't used very often at all. People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons. Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control. And young people were quite receptive to this, but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older, people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition. There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well. and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it. And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control, it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions, and to find your way around it. My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market, and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power, and also volume and that sort of thing, as as Louisa said.	The Marketing Expert discussed user requirements with the group and showed that users wanted a fancier, less complicated remote that would not be easily lost.
Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here, the the sort of circular section, because that seems to be for a video as well. So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume. And I don't really think that you need nine numbers. I mean how often do you use seven, eight and nine? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough. Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time, and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels. but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place, certainly the button up and down, and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others. Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels Um some remotes have kind of favourite options Yeah, I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred, you could go one to one to ten, ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff, that would be tuned to one channel, and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels. Limit the number of buttons, But I suppose nine's not really excessive. you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever, How many buttons have we got? We've just got ten, eleven twelve th Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market	The group discussed making their remote more user-friendly; they proposed eliminating rarely-used buttons and making it easier to skip through channels.
And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone, you lose that and you can ring it. Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two. So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else, wherever the remote actually is. Yeah, we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well, There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at, and then they whistle back, or something like that. That'd probably be really simple, or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote. Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing, you know without sound recognition. I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way Um I was gonna say a sharp noise, you know a clapping of hand or whatever. a set command whatever that happened to be. and you can give it a command, because it'll recognise the voice you could have an option to turn it off. Or So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels. Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control? Well if it does then we can't.	The group discussed how to incorporate a locator function.
Um we could maybe come up with a menu, a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control. Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well, because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design. And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room, rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels. 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise, so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel. What was that last wee bit there? Um about speech recognition? But that was only for young people that preferred it, older people didn't. and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition. Um.	He suggested incorporating a menu and an LCD screen to satisfy these requirements.
Um okay, so very brief presentation, um. From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute, none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy. Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there, um but there's some curved cases that you can see, uh a range of sizes uh. All of them have a lot of buttons there um Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at, one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions. And uh it was quite uh a swish model, I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing Um the scroll buttons, as you've already mentioned, um there's examples of those, but they don't look as sleek as other models. and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great. Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about, um. There was children's remote, where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels. Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications. So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever, and then you could have additional features You'd have model one, model two and model three, So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step, and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments.	The User Interface Designer presented several existing products.
So I don't think it would effect our circuit board. But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly, it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message. so we'd have a simple circuit board And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it. so we'd stick with the simple circuit board Are we going for speech recognition? Just just for the call and find thing. It's it's just an addition thing but Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later.	They decided that using speech recognition for the locator function only would allow them to use a simple chip.
Um that's a that's a decision for all of us. Um. So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue, I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were. that's probably a better one, to discuss it straight away. so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance. Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel, The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information. Um. the scroll wheel required the regular, The display requires an advanced chip And note that the push button just requires a simple chip, Yeah, and if we're going for sleek and sexy, I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky? So maybe just a simple push button, Yeah, a simple pushbuttons. Did everyone get this on the speech recognition? So it is basically the concept we discussed before. Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board. So if we go for the simple push button, so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we? I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires, maybe before we m make a decision. But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly, it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message. So I don't think it would effect our circuit board. so we'd have a simple circuit board And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it. so we'd stick with the simple circuit board W w kinetic. I I thought so just for just for ease of not having	The group discussed incorporating speech recognition and other functions to be able to decide on chip size.
So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons, that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button. So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition, um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board. Um and for the circuit board, again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote. if we're gonna have the speech recognition, we'd have to probably get an advanced one. I'm guessing. Uh but I don't know, so that is something I'll have to look into.	He showed that the size of the chip was dependent on the type and number of additional features used.
For the components design, um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before. We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate. Then there is a chip and still the sender. So um yes including the power s supply as well. Uh first in the power supply, we have the option of just the standard battery, There's a dynamo. There's a kinetic option, which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced. but I think that was gonna cost a little more. And then there's solar cells. Um as a final option. For the buttons, we have um an integrated push button, which I guess is just the same as the standard ones. This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer. Um there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down, Um one issue for the buttons is, depending on which material we use, if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case, What would be the cost do do we know? I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost, that that related to the actual buttons, but it does affect the printed circuit board. The firm supplies a simple, a regular and an advanced um circuit board. So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons, that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button. Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition. There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost, Um going to my personal preferences, um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic And this would avoid batteries running out, having to replace batteries and such like. Um for the buttons, I thought we'd probably get	The Industrial Designer discussed options for each of the internal components.
Right well um from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes, but uh it didn't work out too well, so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting, I can quickly give you what we what we had. Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device. We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself, that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time. We're gonna have uh effectively two pages, a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted, and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements.	The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting.
So maybe just a simple push button, Yeah, a simple pushbuttons. Alright, so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons, So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply?	The remote will feature push buttons instead of scroll buttons, and a kinetic power supply.
I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever.	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will construct the prototype.
I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there, and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do, it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function. the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote. and and the voice recognition, we can use that can't we, just to find it. Without affecting the circuit board.	They also decided to market the speech recognition component as a "finder function" so as not to confuse it with more advanced speech recognition components in other remote controls.
I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching. Right, um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them, what was bad, what they used. And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment. So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends. The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional. And second, there should be some technological innovation. And then third and l less important than the other two, there should be an ease of use as well. And apparently, the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme. Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy, we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else. And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap. And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations. So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg, or the the buttons could be spongy, uh somehow. And then sort of even wackier than that, we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote, How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends, do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget, or or you know, do they not matter that much?	The Marketing Expert presented trends in the remote control market and the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion.
say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions. Maybe that could be a little apple. And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit. Or veg. Could be a red apple, yeah.	The group decided to make the standby button in the shape of an apple.
so we'd stick with the simple circuit board	The remote will contain a simple chip.
Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design. Um just to avoid ambiguity. Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this, to have triangular buttons, um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up, they might see yeah, they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down, whereas the actual button's pointing up, so the function is to turn the button up. So, be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them, because they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes. So maybe we could have volume written on the side	She expressed that buttons are often ambiguously shaped and that their remote must have an easy-to-use interface.
Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about, um. There was children's remote, where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels. Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications. So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever, and then you could have additional features You'd have model one, model two and model three, So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step, but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments.	She presented a specialized children's remote; the group decided to focus on a basic remote that would appeal to a wide market.
but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here	The group decided to focus on a basic remote that will appeal to the widest market.
I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped, it might make it more complicated to use. Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons, Maybe just one button, I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends. to something which is maybe more universal. But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design, Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about, um. Maybe still with a rubber design we could The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change? Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year, uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like, rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle. You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that, I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside. Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case, But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme, aren't we? You could have your company badge and logo. I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there, it actually has a sort of um stick on badge And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider. I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into. Okay, so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end	The group discussed ways to incorporate these trends.
I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there, it actually has a sort of um stick on badge You could have your company badge and logo.	The remote will feature the company logo, possibly in a sticker form.
say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions. Maybe that could be a little apple. th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people, if you're looking for functionality. If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg, next year's uh I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever. It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases, as well as buttons. Rubber buttons require rubber case. Okay, so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year, you know. it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case, and then have the standard rubber buttons as well. Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel? But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine. one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other. Shall we go for single curve, just to compromise? We'll go for single curve, yeah. And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit. Or veg. so it's not really spongy feel buttons, it's just rubber buttons. Could be a red apple, yeah. Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can, 'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain. Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple.	They decided to make the standby button shaped like an apple, to use a rubber case and buttons, and to use a single-curved shape.
It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases, as well as buttons. Rubber buttons require rubber case. Shall we go for single curve, just to compromise? We'll go for single curve, yeah. And the rubber push buttons, rubber case. Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can,	The remote will also feature a rubber case and rubber buttons, and a single-curved design.
And the speech feature.	A sample sensor was included to add speech recognition.
Okay, so, by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements.	A simple chip is going to support the electronics of the device.
So we're now on to project process. Now satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means, et cetera, whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera. I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down, which I will do. Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough? I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary. Well, we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings, and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one, you know, sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where, you know, you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness, but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons, and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that. The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process, you would normally, you go to a meeting, you decide, right, you do this, you do that, you do that. Then you go away. You find out information. You then come back. You then discuss it. Whereas, this time, you're really getting it from a database source, what do you want to put down? Creativity, seemed okay. Um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed. I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project. It was quite good with this um the white board, having that and the digital pens. so how do you reckon teamwork went? That went okay, yeah. I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them. To uh go uh reasonably well.	The team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity, although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed.
If you have a in plastic rather than rubber, then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then, you could keep your sample sensor, which gets us um In right within the budget range. and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements. Yeah, I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case. So we're going for plastic, yes? Oh actually we just have a plastic case, then we lose two points, we've got nought point eight left, Well, we've got special form. Now that would be one button, and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button. 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour. So, special colour, you want three in there. Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour One original colour and then sort of two supplements, I think maybe. Maybe that'll be a second supplement. the volume ones should stand out a bit. You were making these buttons down the bottom, I was presuming, bigger than the other ones, And we've got special form is the one apple. Then there's a spe a second special form. Yeah, that's twelve point three, So I think that should still be okay. Well, in this one, you've actually got three colours of buttons. we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to. Well, we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour.	Changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour.
we did find a new idea, I mean sort of a kinetic remote control. voice recognition, especially not could You've got voice recognition computers, that's not remote controls. Yeah, so it's just like the same products, but just put together in a different way. New ideas found, so one or two. Kinetic powered remote control. Um, Voice um recognition thing.	Finally, some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition.
I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project. I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing. But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control, in a way. I mean this one seems. From the website it looks it's quite innovative, I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything Bit bit arbitrary. Well, I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products.	However, the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting, especially since the requirements restricted it to TV only, and the budget was too small.
So, we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven, isn't it, with everything we want on.	The initial cost was calculated at 13.70 Euros.
Okay, so, by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements. I switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor.	It uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition.
and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated. And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven, So, I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well, at the end. Um so, We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy. Um The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation. Whether it's easy to use. Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer. And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product. And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently, So the first one is um, does the product look and feel fancy. Okay, well we have a single curve, Um, then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel, which was in at the time. Yeah, I'd maybe give it a a two. What Is one false, or is t one true? One's true. So uh say about a two for fancy, And I mean, how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon? Um, deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition, and if we had either of those for our budget, they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition. we've got we've got the speech recognition on it, haven't we. So it says if we make a slightly more fancy, then we lose points innovation, and if we make it more innovative innovative, then we lose points on it being fancy, so I would go for a one on that at this point in time. Um, incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer. it's got the cherry and the sponginess. Say about a three maybe? The product is a recognisable real r uh reaction product? I woulda said two would seem reasonable. and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from. So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that	On a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (1), incorporation of fashion elements (2), and brand recognition (2).
Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first, and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after?	Although over budget, the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes.
So we're going for plastic, yes?	The case will be made of plastic.
Well, but you've got the company logo on there, which would effectively be a stick-on badge. Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity, I don't know.	The team were not certain to what extent the prototype satisfied recognisability of the corporate identity.
Y no, it's a slightly curved around the sides. Cherry would be alright actually. We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top. Yeah, and cherries are fun, summery. And did we make it a cherry officially? Yeah. Okay, so, by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements.	The remote will be single-curved with a cherry design on top.
it's got the cherry and the sponginess. And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one. Maybe other ones could be something else shaped. So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button, then maybe they could be a different shape. Yeah, I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something, maybe.	On the other hand, it was argued that the special colours and form compensated for that.
Well we've made our prototype anyway. You pass it round to have a look. Y no, it's a slightly curved around the sides. Um, it's almost curved like up to the main display as well. And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down. And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line. We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top. Cherry would be alright actually. Yeah, and cherries are fun, summery. For the first time, well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons. Uh, we just chose simple shapes for all them. Um, the important ones are the volume ones. So we made them a bit bigger. Hum, you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons, so you've got the volume in orange on design there, and the the channel is in blue. And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button. so uh but there would be a cost implication on that, Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important, but we didn't have any white Play-Doh. Yes, we'll have the slide-away.	The first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top.
Uh, don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary. I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting.	The team have two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting to complete before they finish.
So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it, How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic? If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough. So we're going for plastic, yes? Lose a little bit on the fashion, yeah, but	After changing the case material from rubber to plastic, it was debated that the loss of sponginess does affect the fancy appeal and trendiness of the remote.
Um, well we've still got the kinetic energy. Um	The remote is going to be powered by kinetic energy.
Yeah, I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something, maybe. well, we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something.	Volume buttons will be lemon-shaped and coloured.
well, we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something.	However, volume and channel buttons will be different from the rest.
Well, we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour. I think if they were just all small round blue buttons, it'd be fine.	The buttons will be made of rubber mostly in a light blue colour.
Did you get told what the company colour is or I'm still not quite sure we've established that. so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline. So basically, even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display, because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo, it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product.	They were not certain what the colour of the company logo should be and how the logo should be displayed.
Um, we want it to cost, uh, absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents.	The control will cost a maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents to produce.
Um, and make it for an international market.	The remote will target the international market.
Yes, it's a television remote control.	It will be a television remote control.
Um, you will get specific instructions, um, of what to do in the next half an hour.	They were recieve specific instructions on what to do.
Um, we'd like to, um to, uh, make fifty million Euro.	The profit will be fifty million Euros.
um, wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros.	The selling price will be twenty five Euros.
Um, U_I_D_ the technical functions design will, will be worked on the next thirty minutes.	The Interface Designer will do the technical functions design.
Industrial Designer. You'll be beginning your, your working design.	The Industrial Designer will be doing the working design.
Um, like you can go over your ideas, of course, in your own personal times. Um, our next meeting will be in half an hour. Industrial Designer. You'll be beginning your, your working design. Um, U_I_D_ the technical functions design will, will be worked on the next thirty minutes. and, um, we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert. Um, you will get specific instructions, um, of what to do in the next half an hour.	Then the project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what to do in preparation for the next meeting.
um, the next, um, thing we need to address is our financial department, to meet our our budget, um, wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros. we can like the price to create it will be significantly less. Um, we want it to cost, uh, absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents. so we'll have a hundred percent profit then? So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas, any um suggestions that you may have so far, I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing. Um, we'd like to, um to, uh, make fifty million Euro. Um, and make it for an international market. I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing. So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was. There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel, so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something. Do yous not find that, um, like, there's a lot of, um, buttons on your remote control, and you don't know what half of them do. Are we going into kind of novelty factors here. I suppose, if we're he heading to have it, like make a huge profit out of this, it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing. And the key issue here is, is being trendy and original.	After that the project manager covers the project budget, and then they begin discussing their personal experiences with remote controls and how they want their remote to look.
And, um, as a sort of team-building moment, um, I, I'd like us to, um, try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal. My favourite animal, which changes all the time, okay, right now it is an elk. like all sorts of animals, but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat, in memory of my poor cat that died recently. and it, it is my favourite animal right now, 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature, But I like cats because they're so independent, I think my favourite animal would be a dog,. Um, I like dogs because, um, they're so good to humans, I'm going to draw a butterfly, because I saw a butterfly yesterday, that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving.	Next, each group member draws their favorite animal on the whiteboard and explains the characteristics of that animal.
and then, um, after we've brainstormed and, and thought about, we can come together in a meeting and, and discuss what, what um, what kind of functional design we want to use. Same with conceptual design and detailed design.	The meetings will focus on functional, conceptual, and detailed design.
And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today, um um as well as planning the project, as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control. Um, we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy, um, a completely new style, so that, um, can really appeal to a, to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of, uh, channel-changer. And, um, it needs to be user-friendly for, um, maybe, for an example, for people that, um, can't see the numbers as well, Yes, it's a television remote control.	She then states the agenda of the meeting and tells them that they will be designing and creating a new remote control that should be trendy and user-friendly.
Welcome to the meeting everyone. This is the first meeting uh for developing our, our new product. I'm Heather, I'm your Project Manager. If everyone could go around and explain their role and um, and their name.	The project manager opens the meeting by introducing herself and asking everyone to say their name and role in the group.
and, um, we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert.	The marketing expert will do the user requirements.
Would we be the company that would break down these, or uh metals? One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector. Um, so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us, cost the company, And, um, the next presenter will be Tara. There're two functional design options. A multifunctional remote control, which can be used for several entertainment devices. And a single function remote control, used specifically for the television. Um, multifunctional controls can be difficult to use, as the multitude of buttons can be confusing. A single function remote control is simpler to use, but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices. Um, I think that a single function remote control would be preferable, It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets, making it more internationally sellable. And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic. And less functions would have to be included. So it would be cheaper to make.	The group asks some questions about this idea and then the interface designer presents about technical functions, explaining the difference between a multifunctional and single function remote.
So as far as we know, um, a single function television remote control is us usable internationally? Um, I was just wondering about the, what, what Genevieve said before, about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing. And that would probably, um, I d, well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design. Does anyone object and, and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go? because we're trying to do so much, that if we're trying to make a unique, user-friendly, dadada, and it's also multi also multifunctional, um, we're gonna go over budget for one thing. And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design.	The group discusses the two types and decides that a single function design is more suitable for the budget.
Okay. So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control. Um, I've done some marketing research, a lot of interviews with remote control users, um, and some internet research. and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose. So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products. Um, hence our motto, we put the fashion in electronics. Um, and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design. Not just in electronic fashion. Any trends that are going on in, in the public, even media, Um, seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly. Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. Um, seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot. Um, and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons. And actually to go with that, I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons, how much they're used. Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour. Teletext, um, now I'm not too clear on what that is. Um, and has a r a high relevance of six point five. Remote controls are often lost somewhere. Um, remote controls are bad for R_S_I_. Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that, you know, you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working.	The marketing expert presents on user requirements by using research done on remote control users.
so it might be very appealing if, um, we have very concise buttons. And another thing with um lots of surfing, we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable, So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control. But we'll have to also avoid, you know, buttons responding to the slightest touch as well. So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're, we're targeting, and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into. Um, I think our priority really should be unique design. so uh in my opinion it should be, um, user-friendly and unique. Um, I th myself, voice recognition kind of scares me off. I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds, we could go for the fancy stuff. But if we wanna make fifty million, and and have everyone want this remote control, we should maybe stick to the basics. Um, so I I think, I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more.	She summarizes these findings andexplains her personal preference for a user-friendly, unique design since certain features could be too complex.
welcome back fro to the second meeting. the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation.	The project manager opens the meeting, asking the industrial designer to present first.
Um, so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design, Uh, on a functional side of things, we found out that wh from our previous meeting, we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique. Um, one is the visibility in the dark, And we could use illuminated buttons, Or we could use fluorescent materials Um, also we could use um an alarm. So if we lost the um remote control, perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself, which you could press, Um, another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design. Um also there is um components. But I haven't put this plan together yet. This would actually show the circuit diagram. Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet. I it just shows what sort of energy source. It could be a battery,	The industrial designer begins talking about the functional aspect of the working design and features to make the product unique, such as visibility in the dark, locator alarm, and environmentally-friendly materials.
Um, another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design. Um, from previous researches I've carried out on other projects, um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory. So they can be heated and um and cooled, and they change the shape of um the metal. So um, the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life, if it was heated, um everything would spring apart. So, all the um individual components could be easily separated, and then some could be reused, some could be recycled, I mean, the user would return the p product to the company, 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made.	To make an environmental impact, they could use smart materials that can be heated and cooled so that the individual components easily separate to be reused or recycled.
Um, so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us, cost the company, We'll have to do more research.	Will reserach environmental factor.
We could, may, possibly, sorry, incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material.	Will consider using number-shaped buttons.
I think that we should incorporate that. You could start out with three, and if, if we hit it big then we can add some on.	Will research changable covers.
I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had.	Alarm locator will be implemented.
um, the glow-in-the-dark, fluorescent, whatever, system, um is a go ahead. So we've decided on lighting up things.	Glow in the dark buttons, self-timed lighting.
So, um, all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way.	Remotes must incorporate corporate logo and color.
So no L_C_D_, no teletext, and no voice recognition.	No LCD, no voice recognition.
Um, so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us, cost the company, Um, the environmental factor, we didn't bring that up again. We'll have to do more research.	Need to research using envrionemntal materials.
because we're trying to do so much, that if we're trying to make a unique, user-friendly, dadada, and it's also multi also multifunctional, um, we're gonna go over budget for one thing. And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design. Um, for one thing, because Having controls with D_V_D_, V_C_R_, that sort of thing, would really complicate the design of the remote control. Um, we've decided not to include them and make it a specific, just a specific television um function.	The remote will be a single function design- television only.
Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated, because more people are using the internet now.	Teletext is outdated and will not be used.
Would it need a battery then? So, mm, more research into that one.	Need to research on whether locator device will need a separate battery.
I think that we should incorporate that. You could start out with three, and if, if we hit it big then we can add some on.	Need to research possibility of changable covers.
Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like, I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions. Um, for one thing, because Having controls with D_V_D_, V_C_R_, that sort of thing, would really complicate the design of the remote control. Um, we've decided not to include them and make it a specific, just a specific television um function. Which is good as, as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway. Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated, because more people are using the internet now. So, um, all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way. but for the purposes of this meeting I, I wasn't offered a, like a type of logo or colour, It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow.	The project manager receives some decision-affecting information from management, which she shares with the group.
Um, so, now we need to discuss, um and come to a decision on our remote control functions, of, of how this is going to be. Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option? I don't use teletext that much, but if it was on your T_V_, you'd want to be able to use it, It was a management decision, so it's, it's pretty much out of our hands at this point. Um, well I guess, just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons. I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had. Would you be able to, um, put the little device anywhere? so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere, or something. It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess, but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller. So, mm, more research into that one. Would it need a battery then? um, the glow-in-the-dark, fluorescent, whatever, system, um is a go ahead. Um right, if w if we're minimising buttons, we might be able to make them actually larger. We could, may, possibly, sorry, incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material. I just thought that it, it might be sucking more battery power, if there, if it is a light up. Um, so like big b um buttons, for people you are visually impaired. I guess the other option, referring to the battery thing is, you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something, when you're s and then it goes, Um, if instead of a constant light up on the, on the remote control, if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again. That's probably feasible. Um, did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look? Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly? Because it might, for, for our design purposes, I mean, the	They have a discussion about the remote control functions and close the meeting.
And, okay, in closing, 'cause we only have five minutes. Um, you'll be working, Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design. And you'll be evaluating the product. and um the user interface design, so this is where the trendy stuff comes in. Poppy and Tara will have to work together, using modelling clay. And, um, your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen.	The project manager closes the meeting, stating what each member's next task will be.
Yeah, it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring. It's, it's a little but it, it's everywhere. I think we possibly could take a more abstract design. Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables. I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry, but it could have the curves of a strawberry, or something. I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting, we talked about our favourite animals. So maybe there could be animal-based, you know. Energy, we've decided on kinetic, right? I, I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential. It could even be one of our selling points. I think we decided on the pushbuttons, right? Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting, the interior lighting system? So regular chip. Uh, so that's the simple. is regular not simple? because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well. Well, I guess plastic and coated in rubber. yeah, interchangeable plates. and supplements. What's that all about? what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions, colours and forms, in the in consistent use. We haven't really decided what to do about that. just just the basic button functions. Like we, I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of So we're just going for power, channels, volume, Should we have audio? it's a problem with the international uh appeal, I think. Um, if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work. We can just go for, make it a selling point that it is just the basic. 'cause it, mm it is a good sales ploy to say, aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons.	The group discusses how they could implement these fashion trends into the design, then finalizes a few decisions about the components, materials, and energy sources.
Um, you'll be working, Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design.	The industrial designer will work on the look-and-feel design.
So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber. Well, I guess plastic and coated in rubber.	Case will be plastic and coated in rubber.
just just the basic button functions. So we're just going for power, channels, volume, We can just go for, make it a selling point that it is just the basic.	Functions will be basic, including power, channels, volume.
and um the user interface design, so this is where the trendy stuff comes in.	The interface designer will work on the user interface design.
The fruits and vegetable themes, I don't know if that's going to work for us. Yeah, it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring. It's, it's a little but it, it's everywhere. I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry, but it could have the curves of a strawberry, or something.	The group would like to use a fruit and vegetable theme but are not yet sure how to implement it into their product.
Poppy and Tara will have to work together, using modelling clay.	The industrial and interface designers will be working together using modelling clay.
Should we have audio? it's a problem with the international uh appeal, I think. Um, if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work.	The group was uncertain whether to add audio, because they would have to make it compatible with TVs on an international scale.
And you'll be evaluating the product.	The marketing expert will be evaluating the product.
'cause it, mm it is a good sales ploy to say, aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons. We can just go for, make it a selling point that it is just the basic.	They decide to eliminate it and make simplicity their sales pitch.
And, um, your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen.	Their personal coaches will give the rest of the information
And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter. Um, first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made, Um, thes main internal feature is a circuit board, which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source. Um, there are several components of, um, the circuit board that we need to consider, where we'll be getting them from, what they'll be made of. Um, including the integrated circuit, which is also known as the chip. they're all separate, apart from the chip, which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple, a regular, advanced. so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things, with that as well. Okay, there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source. We could use a basic battery, There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago. Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed. Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices, where you just shake the device and it gives it power. Um, or there's solar power, which we've been considering inside a building, which is where it's gonna be used, might not be quite so useful. Um, lots of considerations for the case, like what sort of shape it would be, curved or flat. We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up. we could use metal, we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_. Um, titanium is not gonna be possible, even though it just it beyond our budget really. Um right our choice for buttons as well. with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons. they're basically quite a flexible design, modern, you don't have to use individual buttons. Um one thing with the scroll buttons though. we would have to have an L_C_D_ um and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult. Um, also we've got the integrated pushbutton, which is what	The industrial designer presents first and talks about the components of a remote, energy source options, and materials for the remote, case, and buttons.
I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway, to make it more simplistic.	Command interface is the best for a remote, so it will be used.
Well, welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design. on the agenda for this, um, for this particular meeting, we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting, after we came up with um some general ideas of our design. And, um, then we have to make some key decisions on, on our remote control concept, and how we're gonna make it, what uh materials we're gonna use, and that sort of thing. The meeting will be forty minutes long.	The project manager opens this conceptual design meeting and gives them the agenda.
so we have that taken care of. Um, the temporary light-up idea, sounds like we're gonna stick to that.	Control will light up when you touch a button.
But if we're having a simplified display anyway, w that, we probably won't have to focus so much on that. It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume. It'd be more a command interface, I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway, to make it more simplistic.	They decide the command interface is most useful for a remote because it is simpler and more user-friendly.
and I'd like to stick to that. um of course, as we, we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting, yeah, interchangeable plates.	Will use personal face places.
Um, I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now. Uh, first of all I'll explain what a user interface is. Um, there are two types of user interfaces. There's the graphical user interface, which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device, for example a mouse for input control. I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen. So you must, for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics. No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the, that's on the buttons of the remote control,	The interface specialist presents the interface concept by explaining the difference between graphical and command interface.
Energy, we've decided on kinetic, right?	The remote will run on kinetic energy.
this report is about uh trend-watching. And the recent fashion update, uh, according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan, is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. Um, also, in contra uh in contrast to last year, the feel of the material is expected to be spongy. um of course, as we, we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting, and I'd like to stick to that. The fruits and vegetable themes, I don't know if that's going to work for us.	The marketing expert presents on trend-watching and talks about how fruit and vegetables are an important fashion theme this year, and says the material used is expected to be spongy.
I think we decided on the pushbuttons, right?	Push buttons will be used.
We, we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our, um, more user-friendly remote control, that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons, that their functions, colours and forms aren't always helpful. It can be a bit, yeah, overwhelming. But what about the lighting up effect? Um, well, um, I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up. I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards. I'd assume, like, an internal light, that comes through. So there would have to, have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons, or something. and well rubber is a more translucent product too, Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe? 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone. You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons. I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the, the top casing.	The group discusses aspects of the user interface including the lighting up effect and material of the buttons.
So regular chip.	Regular chip will be used.
Alright so based on this evaluation, do we average them out sorta thing? Yeah it is one point nine.	They average the scores and get 1.9.
um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers Okay, as for the colours, we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype.	Numbers have a circular design.
Do we have a fancy look-and-feel? We've been quite successful with the rubber coating The look is a little bit more playful. Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy, I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen. I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy. I kinda I like the potato look. It's a two? Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative. and the use of the rubber. and we don't have any scroll buttons, it's all pushbuttons, there's no L_C_D_ control, so if we're thinking about the rest of the market, it's sort of probably halfway. we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this, because then that would've defeated the purpose. we'll put three, but I think we actually reached our goal. Uh, will it be easy to use? Yeah. One. you can't really get confused with that. The plus number thing. But once that's figured out, it should be fine. Is this a good-looking remote? Again I think the colour comes into this. I think that the logo could be smaller. Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent. I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand. where's it gonna sit in your living room? the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit. But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand. Would we wanna show it off to our friends? Okay, so should we say two for that? will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product? I think we have to market it in the right way, that um to say that it is simplistic. And the kinetic energy part. No, I guess, I don't know much about the remote control industry, how much your average sells for, About ten pounds. But you don't have to buy	The criteria includes fancy look-and-feel, technological innovation, ease of use, look, whether people would be willing to spend 25 Euros for it, whether its operating behavior matches the average user, ease of finding when lost, ease of learning to use, whether it will minimize RSI, incorporation of company colors and logo, and whether it follows the motto.
I mean we weren't really given a lot of time, or materials, yeah, to go about our design task. Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess, but m and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen, and like solar power backup and everything, then we wouldn't have been able to afford that. Good leadership, I think we stayed on task. and also our personal coach helped us along the way, We never were pushed for time, or sat around doing nothing, so I think we worked great as a team. We needed more Play Doh colours. The computer programmes are good. Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other,	In evaluating the project process they are pleased with their creativity, leadership, timing, teamwork, discussions, and overall product given the resources they had.
So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing. Um we're using a regular chip. Um, it's cur it's double curved, so its curved all around. Um, we're using plastic and rubber, So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours Well one colour for the case, one colour for the buttons. So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros.	They check the product costing and find that their operating cost is 12.20 Euros.
Fantastic. Thank you very much.	They close the meeting by thanking one another.
Um we're using a regular chip.	Will use a regular chip.
Um, it's cur it's double curved, so its curved all around.	The remote will be double-curved.
Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme, the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit, But we're thinking that, seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway, like banana could be black and yellow, watermelon red and green,	Casing will be interchangable and color schemes will be named and colored after fruits and vegetables.
So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours	Will be two colors, one for case and one for buttons.
Um, we're using plastic and rubber,	Will be made of plastic and rubber (rubber on remote for comfort).
And we have the company logo here It's in the middle of one of the little R_s. And then the other one is the power. So it's palm-held. buttons are accessible from your thumb.	They point out the company logo and LED, and demonstrate how the device is palm-held and thumb-acessible.
It's a pretty simple design. It's um based on a mango?	The designers give the prototype presentation, showing their simple design that is based on a mango.
Evaluation criteria is next in line. Um, we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen. Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings, um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were, Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false. So basically the lower p the lower the points the better.	The marketing expert administers the product evaluation, and they rate each of the ten criteria on a scale of 1-7.
And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus. So one plus one would be eleven, You press a plus button? I've never heard of that kind before. but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five, channel sixty five, if I press the six it'll go to channel six, and then I'll press the plus, and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five? we can further define that. I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first, in like on the way to channel sixty five. like as long as we realise that's what it'll do. Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think. um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb. Okay, as for the colours, we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype. that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use. Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme, the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit, But we're thinking that, seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway, like banana could be black and yellow, watermelon red and green, Banana's more representative of our colour scheme, like the company the yellow and black. or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in	They also discuss the numerical, volume, channel, and power buttons as well as the color scheme.
Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers. And then we will evaluate it, given the criteria that um that we gave gave it. And um talk about our finances, whether we were under or over our budget.	The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda.
so then we forget the ball.	The team will not create a ball shaped remote.
Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like? We want it to be a b a ball, I could draw sorta the ball idea. this is where it's connected together, and then when you open it out, it could fol it could be maybe flip, like a flip phone, Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it. um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really, Also also you risk the hinges here. That's that's um a problem. so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least, down here somewhere, but that's of course a weak point, yeah. I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball? The shape is perhaps not the most ideal. there must be a compromise between um stability and design here, so. I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote, it's not innovative, everybody does long remote My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape, you know, like video games We could also try to do the hinge thing, so it could like flip out that way. but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier. I mean maybe design something, that's sort of like So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better. Because even I suppose even with the ball it still not the ho easiest thing to hold, yeah. I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job. if it's small it probably looks better, may not be th as functional. say we went with the ball the ball function um, but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to. But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom, then that eliminates our ball anyways. And then we have the problem with the hinge. The question is also, I dunno, d do you really always want to open that thing when	The team discussed universal usage, how to find remotes when misplaced, shapes and colors, ball shaped remotes, marketing strategies, keyboards on remotes, and remote sizes.
Generally, all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance. Do we want something crazy? we want something new that's gonna stand out. Maybe sorta spherical or something. A ball. We want it to be a b a ball, I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote, it's not innovative, everybody does long remote keyboard type shape, you know, like video games Because even I suppose even with the ball it still not the ho easiest thing to hold, yeah. So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better. But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom, then that eliminates our ball anyways. so then we forget the ball. So we've got our sort of keyboard kind.	What shape the remote should be.
marketing, you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there.	The marketing expert will find out what the most universally appealing remote control on the market is.
and then when you open it out, it could fol it could be maybe flip, like a flip phone, Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it. Also also you risk the hinges here. That's that's um a problem. but that's of course a weak point, yeah. And then we have the problem with the hinge. The question is also, I dunno, d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it?	Having hinges on a ball shaped remote.
And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want.	The marketing expert will research user preferences
Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be, because of it's stability really, um the ball is a nice idea so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least, down here somewhere, I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball? there must be a compromise between um stability and design here, so.	The stability of a ball shaped remote.
It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros	The remote will sell for 25 Euro.
Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote. Uh I'm Nick Debusk, I'm the Project Manager. Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing, what your what your role is um. I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification, In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation, I'm Ryan. Um I'm the User Interface Designer. Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design. Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control. Um in the concept design, the user interface, And the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design, I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um. In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements, um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on. Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product. And uh the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself,	The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves and describe their roles in the upcoming project.
our our agenda is the opening, uh acquaintance which we've kinda done. Uh tool training, project plan discussion and then closing. we are putting together a new remote control. Um we want it to be something original. Um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company, so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use. Um we've got the functional design, conceptual design and detailed design	The project manager then described the upcoming project.
let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have, and then we can go into how we're gonna design it function of remote control is just just change channels is its main function. we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote? I suppose you c try make it a universal remote But, you know, they all sorta have the same role changing channels, volumes and then programming. I think they all work on the same prin principle as well Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em. So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily, I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature. So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh like a tracking device you could whistle or make a noise there's a button on the T_V_ that you press and it'd beep. Generally, all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance. so they're kinda like long and rectangular. Do we want something crazy? we want something new that's gonna stand out. Maybe sorta spherical or something. A ball. Maybe like user-friendly, where you can use both hands, like a little keyboard type thing. I thought maybe, because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another and maybe the actual controls are inside or something. you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time, so there are always the some restrictions Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be, How sturdy is it gonna be? we want it to to hold up to somebody's child, you know, throwing it across the room so ball-shaped, uh you know, if it were ball-shaped maybe, It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside. we want it to be modern	The team then discussed their experiences with remote controls.
It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros, what they wanna make on it, so. Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association, maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal. marketing, you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there. And maybe as far as design goes, maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences, I think, sometimes remotes have too many buttons, so maybe as simple as possible, um as few buttons inside as possible. if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it.	They also discussed the project budget and which features they would like to see in the remote control they are to create.
the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan,	The corporate color and slogan must be incorporated into the design.
Um we want something that's simple. User interface concept, we want it to be something simple.	The remote will be simple.
Um the remote's only gonna be for the television,	The remote will only be used for televisions.
Um no teletext. Um	The team will not work with teletext.
And Ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user. So both of those concepts.	The user interface designer will explore how well a rounded, ergonomic remote and a two-piece remote work with the user.
you're watching trends	The marketing expert will examine trend watching reports
let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece. So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand. Um	The team will explore the option of a two-piece remote.
the last meeting we went over um who was responsible for what. I'm responsible for leading the meetings, keeping the notes, uh and coming up with the final presentation. Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert. Um Ryan is our User Interface Designer. And Manuel is the Industrial Designer. Um we decided our remote, uh we want it to be a universal remote Um we want to be modern, um fun, different. Uh it needs to be sturdy, um easy to find, so we gonna have that locator function. Um and we want to be different. Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas. Ball-shaped phone. The keyboard shape. Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed. Something we could use with one hand.	The project manager recapped the events and decisions of the previous meeting.
as far as speech recognition goes, um the younger group looks like they're all for it. From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more. And it kind of just went down incrementally. so maybe we could discuss this and decide if we think it's worth investing in this. At least if we're targeting the younger groups.	The research also indicated that younger users were interested speech recognition.
Having just listened to what Corinne just said, I'll draw on some of the things as well. Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say. I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design. Um the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control. And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change, programme and operate an electronic device remotely. Um I had some things sent to me. Not very much. To look at similar devices. Um we discussed a universal one. But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design, and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it, um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies. You have to set them, reset them to everything. Um and that would only add buttons. Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons. So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s. here here's just two pictures of remote controls. But one is uh user-centred. And you can straight away see there's less buttons. And the other one is engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred. Fewer buttons, simpler to use, maybe the other fifty percent, the buttons that are used very rarely like programming, they could be hidden maybe some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away. the major findings market researchers have said, it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike. So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend. our product I think should be user interface orientated. Um Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control,	The user interface designer spoke on the option to have a universal remote, presented two differently designed remotes available on the market, and described some features a user-centered remote should include.
this is my report, which is going to be based pretty much on a survey first of all, the method that I used was by doing some marketing research, by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted. And then some internet research. I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed. And so I will show you some of the results from that, They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls. And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly. And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy. I think that's definitely important. Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot. And if anyone could clarify what that means? Zap, does that just mean like changing the channel? Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control. they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons. And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all. Of course channel selection is used the most frequently. And then teletext was the next. Volume and then power. And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used. I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button. Um the biggest user frustrations, as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere, and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea. thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote. And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_. as far as speech recognition goes, um the younger group looks like they're all for it. From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more. And it kind of just went down incrementally	The marketing expert presented research on user preferences and tendencies with remote controls.

And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_.	The research indicated that users want remotes to be more attractive, to match the behavior of the user, to be easier to locate when misplaced, and not to cause RSI.
Um from all all three of your uh presentations, I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting. We want something that looks good. Um we want something that's simple. We want something that you can find easily. Um And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take. probably, I would say, probably not worth the investment at this point in time. I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing. if it came with maybe a holder or holster, whatever you wanna call it. But if you don't put it back in, you press something like a little button on that, and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something. Just by infrared. That'd be, that'd be good if we were going with our our ball. Or or with you know I guess with any form that that would be good. that could be the charger. we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote. However, however you wanted to go about it, the holder could also be the charging unit. Um With the locator button. It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components. User interface concept, we want it to be something simple. Um Minimal number of buttons. I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed. The ball is probably not a good idea. Um Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group? if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote. Or girls or older people? I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching. but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that. we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it. yellow it's nice and bright, with the buttons being grey or black. And our slogan pasted somewhere on it, on the the bottom maybe we could flare it or something. of course this will look like a	The team then discussed the option to include a recharger with a locater button in their design, the appearance of their remote, buttons, how to make an ergonomic remote, and the option to have a two-piece remote.
Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use.	The industrial designer will work on components.
Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board. This is the basic basic premise of a remote control. Um the basic function is to send messages to another system. An energy source feeds an integrated circuit, like a chip, Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system. that can compose messages. Often in the form of infrared bits. A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages. Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there. We'll start with an energy source. which is usually a battery This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself. Uh which can be buttons, whatever, which in fact controls a chip. Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp. And Of course that's controlled, the chip itself is controlled by the user interface. The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well, so that you know that it's working basically. The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered. What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared, the sending device basically, the infrared lamp. Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment. The user interface. That's something we can also discuss. We cannot change the chip Or if we just do the usual button thing. Or we have a touch pad or something like that And of course the energy source. Batteries. Solar cells. Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough, developed enough. the more complex we make it of course, the more expensive younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote. possibly it	The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and then the team discussed the option to include speech recognition in their design.
I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements. Um the remote's only gonna be for the television, which is good because we already decided Um no teletext. Um the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan, which is we put the fashion in electronics. And our corporate colours are grey and yellow. And we could probably get away with black too but	The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by.
younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote. possibly it might be worth the investment. I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work. 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone. And you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects I suppose as well. I myself I find, when you, h when there's something like spee speech recognition. Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something. Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end, and you find yours, like you said, saying the same thing over and over and over. Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it, but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money. I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves, a fifteen year old you know. It's a, it's a gimmick factor that they like at first, And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take. probably, I would say, probably not worth the investment at this point in time.	Whether to include speech recognition.
causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually. So. instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person. Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote. Special order. it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person.	How to accommodate left-handed people with an ergonomic design that fits right-handed people.
I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had, with the way that was more like that, So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand. Um	The remote will be rounded in shape such that it fits comfortably in the hand.
I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work. 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone. I myself I find, when you, h when there's something like spee speech recognition. Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something. Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end, and you find yours, like you said, saying the same thing over and over and over.	The reliability of speech recognition.
Uh you've got volume, up and down. I guess you've got you know one through nine. For typing in your channels. Channel up and down. Power. Um a mute. A menu button, maybe.	The remote will have buttons for numbers, volume up and down, channel up and down, power, mute, and a menu.
Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad. Would probably be like a scrolling, little scrolling wheel like this. Like a wheel on your mouse.	The remote will include a scroll action.
yellow it's nice and bright, with the buttons being grey or black.	The remote will be yellow with black or gray buttons.
And our slogan pasted somewhere on it, on the the bottom	The corporate slogan will appear on the bottom of the remote.
Um Minimal number of buttons.	The remote will have a minimal number of buttons.
We want something that looks good.	The remote will look appealing.
We want something that you can find easily. Um	The remote will be easy to find.
Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design.	The industrial designer will work on the look and feel design.
Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design. Um	The user interface designer will work on the user interface design.
Corrine we'll want a product evaluation.	The marketing expert will work on a product evaluation.
So is the two piece idea out? Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery. Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base, having one of them be a base station, Energy source I think we've, I think we've decided batteries, although not exciting, are probably our best bet. Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print, as I said, the the more advanced features you want, um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive. So I guess the case would be plastic, with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it. It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe. So then for the scroll, are we going for the iPod type? Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right?	The team then discussed and decided what components, materials, and energy sources to use.
And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit. Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots? How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously, but uh give it like the surface of an orange, banana, whatever.	The industrial designer also discussed with the how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into their design.
The details of the components' design, as you can see there, what we have is the board, main board of the remote control. top left side you can see the chip, which is the, what we were talking about, this was is the device to recognise the signals the input, Its job is to wait for you to press a key, then to translate that key press into infrared light signals, um that are received by the television. Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time. We are talking something more complicated of course, it's going to be more expensive as well. Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell, or in the material that we could use for our outer shell. So we what we can use is plastic, rubber, wood and titanium. Can also mix these. Um what we could use is, or what I was offered, or what we could use, is a basic bateer battery. So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really. Um solar cell is interesting. May fail though, every here and there. Um the kinetic energy thing um might work, um but the same problem. You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work. So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery. our interface options are push-buttons. however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well. If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented, um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well. solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control. With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design. With plastic, as I understand it	The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the restrictions involved in combining various components, energy sources, and materials.
So I guess the case would be plastic, with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it. It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe.	The case will be made of plastic with rubber grips.
So, then I had a look at new products that are on the market. Um this is the voice, there is a voice recognition remote control, which can control mus multiple devices. And then on the right is obviously an iPod, and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through. And nothing's simpler really. Um then there's things like this, which is a a a kid's remote, where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before. So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components, Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing, where if it was to have a speech recognition thing, And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier, as the actual remote. it could be a graphical display, the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus.	The user interface designer presented three existing products on the market - a voice recognition remote, an iPod, and a children's remote - and discussed a few features to include in the team's design.
So then for the scroll, are we going for the iPod type? Yeah I think so. Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right?	The remote will feature a scroll function similar to the scroll function found on iPods.
The remote will use a more expensive, advanced chip-on-print.
Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they, the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology, where you can program questions into such devices. They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question, you program the answer, and the machine responds accordingly. There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote. Um there's a graphical use, where you you look at pictures and well on a screen. A command line where you obviously type things in, and you get a response. Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes.	The user interface designer briefly described how speech recognition technology works and what ways a user can use a remote.
And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh maybe and and get us a prototype. basically just be working on the prototype, uh we'll accomplish your other two actions.	The user interface designer and industrial designer will work on a prototype
We need to keep it simple, have limited buttons, But I think that, even if it's very subtle, we need to kind of trick our consumers, so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and We brought up the idea of having two pieces, which we could discuss further. Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables. Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones? Personalise your remote.	The marketing expert stressed the need to incorporate these findings into the team's design and suggested that the team should create a remote that has limited buttons , can be personalized, and is not rectangular.
So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery. Energy source I think we've, I think we've decided batteries, although not exciting, are probably our best bet.	The remote will use conventional batteries.
I was given a brief executive summary, and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at. Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design, Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative. And thirdly the remote would be easy to use. And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own, but this just backs it up. As far as fashion update, we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths, shoes and furniture. Um and also, as opposed to last year, this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel.	The marketing expert discussed the results of trend watching reports which indicated a need for products which have a fancy look and feel, are technologically innovative, easy to use, include a fruit and vegetable theme, and are spongy in feel.
I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes. Um we decided that, or we know that we need to use company colours, company logo. our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users. Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before. Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple. Um And that it should look different than what's out there. Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it, Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote, because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity. I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be. Um Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand. And with a scrolling um function also.	The project manager reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting.
Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print, as I said, the the more advanced features you want, um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive. Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right?	What sort of chip to use.
Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots? And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit. So I guess the case would be plastic, with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it.	Whether to use plastic or rubber.
And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit. Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots?	How to have a curved remote made with rubber.
I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable. Or with exterior designs. So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable, Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots? I would say, if I were to make a decision, I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance. I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous, How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously, an orange, banana, whatever. but uh give it like the surface of	How to include a fruit and vegetable theme.
I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me. But I'd like to hear your thoughts. Uh h what did you think of our project process? yeah I think we did quite well. Um Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning. But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing. and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things. Super super. I had some problem with the pen I think, Minus your PowerPoint fiasco.	The team conducted an evaluation of the project process and found that they performed well and were somewhat satisfied by the resources available to them.
So our total is fifteen point five. by three Euros over. you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even, Right. We may not need it.	The costs were over budget, so the team opted to exclude the LCD from their design to meet their budget.
It's very intuitive, I think yeah. 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common, which are channel and volume. So that's a one. Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore. But um if we were to, if we were, that, the speech recognition. That, we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing. Y you could add an extra feature actually. Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television. That can't cost much. Let's add one of those features and say yes. Two.	The team rated the prototype highly on its ease of use and felt that its yellow color and shape detracted slightly from its ability to be misplaced and that a feature which causes the remote to make noise based on its proximity to a television needed to be added.
I think it's definitely different than anything else out there. I'd say, when it comes to the ergonomics, the form and stuff, yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average. So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh, we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly, definitely. I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form. Four is fair.	The team found that, although the overall design of the prototype was attractive, its yellow color was ugly.
Now we get to do the budget numbers. We want a fifty percent profit on this. Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take? Two. That's the advanced chip-on-print, yeah. 'Kay then the case is a Probably it's double curved. Case materials are Plastic. That's not a special colour. It's a specially ugly colour, but it's not special. Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged, we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements.	The project manager led the team in calculating the production costs of the remote and ensuring that they aligned with the project budget.
It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to I don't know that we are that innovative, to tell you the truth. Um I would say we're probably at four. We have some spongy, yeah. It's not a one though. Probably a four at most. I'd say we did. Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour,	The team thought the prototype was fashionable and not technologically innovative or spongy.
This is our last meeting. Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting. Uh and then we'll have a, the prototype presentation. Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget. Um then we'll do the evaluation, and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make, We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel. Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles. Um and a spongy feel. Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity. Um the iPod, we really liked the look of that. the materials for the case, the different energy sources, the different types of chips, um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote.	The project manager opened the meeting and read the minutes of the previous meeting.
Two.	The remote will use two batteries.
Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television. Let's add one of those features and say yes.	The remote will make some sort of noise based on its proximity to a television.
You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria. we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale. And one is going to mean true, that we did actually achieve that. With seven being false, we did not achieve that. So for the first one, we need to decide, did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote? Did we make it simple for new users? Um, do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users? How about the problem of a remote being easily lost? Are we technologically innovative? Um spongy material? did we put the fashion in electronics? Now we just gotta calculate. Okay we'll say two point four two.	The marketing expert conducted an evaluation of the prototype.
'Kay then the case is a Probably it's double curved.	The remote will be double curved.
basically we we st went with the colour yellow. Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned, it's basically designed around a banana. These would be like the rubber, the rubber grips. Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel. And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod, And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go, you press that and go through the menus. we could use the voice. It's as simple as you, we could make it really. Plastic covered with rubber. T the actual thing might be smaller. It's a quick on-off button.	The industrial designer and user interface designer presented the prototype they created, which was designed to look like a banana.
That's the advanced chip-on-print, yeah.	The remote will use an advanced chip-on-print.
by three Euros over. So our total is fifteen point five. What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on. I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though. you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even,	How to meet the project budget.
Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged, we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements.	What sort of button supplements the remote requires.
That's not a special colour. It's a specially ugly colour, but it's not special.	The remote will come in a special color.
Case materials are Plastic.	The remote case will be made of plastic.
But um if we were to, if we were, that, the speech recognition. That, we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing. Y you could add an extra feature actually. Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television. That can't cost much. Let's add one of those features and say yes.	What feature to include to prevent the remote from getting lost.
Right. We may not need it.	The remote will not use an LCD.
Welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project. w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here. Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other. See what our roles are in this project. We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh to communicate and to well, learn from each other's plans w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan. You all know I hope how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design. Uh then we will uh discuss and uh wh what uh what our new product should look lite like.	Then the project manager introduces the meeting by saying they have some technical tools with which to communicate so they will try to get acquainted with them first.
basically this is about a uh a new c remote control. Um When you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original. we want to be distinguished, So it needs to be trendy. People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think, well that's the product I I need. But then, uh, it also should work uh user friendly	He starts talking about the product they are to design, a remote control which should be original, trendy, and user-friendly.
the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase. Um You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design. And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this, the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape.	The general outline of the project will be the functional, conceptual, and detailed design.
but first we will do some uh tool training. and we have here a a a a white-board. I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar. I didn't find out yet how it work, Under documents in the shared folder. I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh. I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share. now we will try out the white-board we have here. Each of us is going. I I'm not really sure how this works, but shall I start? I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard, but they'll be recording what we write down. Maybe maybe Anna, maybe you can start. Why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board. it's a dog. It's a horse. A blue and black zebra. That's that's definitely a cat. it's a shark,	They do some tool training by trying out the whiteboard, and each person draws his/her favorite animal on it.
Let's continue to uh to the real stuff. Um our project uh finance uh thing. Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros, more interesting for our company of course, p uh profit aim, about fifty million Euro. to get at a international market Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents. They have to sell at least four million to make a profit I think w when we are working on the international market, uh in principle it has enough customers And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point, it has to be original, it has to be trendy, it has to be user friendly. Um, maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control. Of course it should have a on off button. i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control. We are targ targeting the television set. You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way, you need to record the channels.	The project manager proceeds to talk about the project finance, which is followed by a group discussion about what functions a good remote control has.
Of course it should have a on off button. You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way, you need to record the channels.	This includes the basics such as on/off, channel up/down browsing, volume and record button(s).
And uh just before starting the detailed discussion, maybe we are the marketing guy? Or I'm marketing. And you are in the u use user interface uh design. And I I'm the the industrial designer I'm Matthew. You know. Mael. Anna. A and I'm Nanne. Are there some other very important things to to do well, the browse function, as you m mentioned. And uh, you'd need the usual ones, like the changing the volume, changing the the channel	At this point they clarify their names and roles in the group and then resume talking about remote control functions.
Today we have uh um teletext and all those things. Tomorrow you might have a some more functions For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up. But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet. Uh w y you two should should, I think, think this over uh w espec what, what functionality. and first before um designing the func thinking about the functionalities, we need to know what are the user requirements. But Ninety percent of the time, ninety nine percent of the time, people will be using the main functions, the volume, the different channels, we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use. Mm mm mm. Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit, so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out, I think. twenty five Euro you expect a quite, well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control. So we need some numbering buttons, some teletext things the main is browsing. Yeah. but but but ab about the spec the buttons, the buttons uh that will be on it. I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting.	They discuss some functions such as a personal video recorder, but say it is probable that they cannot produce a fancy device given their budget.
Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros,	The selling price of the product will be about twenty five Euros each.
And uh you and you and uh uh uh well, think about requirements,	The marketing expert will think about user requirements.
more interesting for our company of course, p uh profit aim, about fifty million Euro. to get at a international market	The profit will be about fifty million Euro.
-The remote will target an international market.
Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents.	The production cost will be twelve Euros and fifty cents.
Uh I would like to get this wrapped up you know now the basic the basic things. just just for the next meeting, um well, uh, you wor yes, work on a design, I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions. Um you will be working on on technical function design, so And uh you and you and uh uh uh well, think about requirements, Does it need internet, or or do do we stay at basic basic television uh interface. and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication. next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh.	The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what he/she will be working on.
and first before um designing the func thinking about the functionalities, we need to know what are the user requirements.	They will need to examine user requirements before deciding on what functionalities are necessary.
Um you will be working on on technical function design, so	The industrial designer will work on the technica function design.
we uh we will wait for Anna, a few minutes. I think you can put anywhere you want, actually. It's not a directional mic, anyway. So I will try to get my presentation running. Can't help you with that. Alt F_ five. Doesn't appear on the screen here. It's working.	The meeting begins with the group trying to resolve some equipment issues and waiting for Anna's arrival.
well, uh, you wor yes, work on a design,	The interface designer will work on a general design.
Of course it should have a on off button. You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way, you need to record the channels. the browse function, as you m mentioned. And uh, you'd need the usual ones, like the changing the volume, changing the the channel	The necessary buttons are on/off, channel up/down browsing, volume, and record button(s).
We are targ targeting the television set.	The remote will be for use with the television set.
Mm mm mm. Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit, so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out, I think. twenty five Euro you expect a quite, well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control. but but but ab about the spec the buttons, the buttons uh that will be on it. I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting.	They have not decided what functions the remote can have, but they have discussed that they may not be able to produce something extremely fancy with the given budget.
But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here. Mm. But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote. So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance We We're not building a universal remote, we're not building a high end product. If we're getting into universal remote territory, we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that I don't know. I don't know whether that's necessary. then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control. And uh basically you can look to the standards of other And if we want to get the market, we really need that. you can also browse through all the standards you know, where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them. uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need	The group is interested in creating a universal remote, however they are unable to deterine what components are needed without looking at the standards and current trends in the market.
so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image, so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all.	The remote should be trendy as possible but still have a reliable image so that it does not appear poorly-functional.
first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less.	Teletext is a well known feature of televisions but is no longer in frequent use because of the internet, will not be used.
and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty, but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group.	They will target the 20-40 age group.
and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market.	The marketing expert will look at what trends are in this type of market
Mm. But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting, especially if we're going after a younger market, that's the the the mm the new and the funky things, for example you have uh presently uh keys like one, two, three like this, actually, and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones, 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way? you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so. so we basically don't change the uh original order of them so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group. Um, basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one? So our our our remote control has to be better. 'cause it's only a low market, it's a cheap-end remote control, we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it, th the design of it they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty, they have to actually need it as well. I think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one Mm. But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote. I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote, So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance We We're not building a universal remote, we're not building a high end product. we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ now you know that chips are very uh cheaps and	They discuss and determine the target group as well as the possibility of making a universal remote for stereo, VCR, and TV.
and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content	The interface designer will get more specific user interface content.
uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need	The industrial designer will try to find out which components are needed.
uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market. and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good we uh we can have lunch now. after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting. But you will be informed via the computer.	They close the meeting with the project manager telling each group member what they will do before the next meeting.
you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on, off button and play, uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option. And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine, but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows, this is the standard one with without any fancy thing like i it doesn't have teletext option,	Standard TV remotes have an on/off button, play, volume change, number keypad, and a 1 or 2 digit option.
I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do, basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set, and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys, people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later. there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household, And then you have uh what's the v video remote file usually it has almost all the keys over there but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those	The Interface Designer gives his presentation, talking about the remote's technical function of sending a message to the TV set that is decoded by the TV.
I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less. That's that's especially because of the internet of course. Do we include it, and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself. further yes we must think, uh do we stay uh to to television only, the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices? Um, furthermore, uh, w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty, and our our current customers are mainly forty plus younger people like trendy trendy designs, so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image, so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all.	The project manager recieves a message from account manager, which he shares with the group.
personal preferences I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together How would that work? so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_? you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program. In that case you want to browse faster, browse slow, you want to have those kind of functionalities. These are kind of next generation functionalities. I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop. and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing. But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here. W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this. for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand, video over-demand or what we call it as, it's presently booming up actually you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies, and then you select those list.	He suggests that in aiming for the next generation they should have a remote for the TV and video integrated together.
Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um. I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group a hundred people, just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control. Um. I've just got a web page with some data on it. Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls. Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Um. Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Um. Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot, Uh. Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons, so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that. Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said? I have an a web page yes. mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh. Uh about this. there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control. Um, power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour. Um, channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um and then there's things like channel settings, audio settings, which are only used very infrequently. Um. Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour, so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used. Um. An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room, so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot	The marketing expert explains the research she read about, which is a study done on 100 people asking their remote usage habits and preferences.
I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you. first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but then uh I had to go to this uh meeting So y you are the secretary also. Yes. Indeed. Then I hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting. Um. W We will uh in a minute we will uh start with them. Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I try to work them out, they were quite abstract, and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it. Uh Um about the functions in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the You mean the social target group who we wants to target? Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this, And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch. uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations? I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything.	The project manager opens the meeting and presents the agenda using slides.
we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design. my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control	He says they should first agree on the technical functions before he creates working design and chooses the chips and infrared components to build it.
and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good you can also browse through all the standards you know, where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them.	More research is necessary to determine this.
I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer. And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control. Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction, how does it work, the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed. an energy source feeds an integrated circuit, the chip, that can compose messages, usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages, the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product. I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work. as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna Uh we want an on off button, it's simple but it's it's important, and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after, the components I quickly draw here, in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver. what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this uh schema And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components. And and why do you want these kind of component? I mean, are they cheap, or are they uh reliable? and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive, this one also really uh reliable that's it for the working design, What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema	The Industrial Designer presents, explaining the basic function of a remote control and how it works.
we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ we can't, with the price range.	One group member brought up that it is not possible to make a universal high-performance remote with the given budget.
do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better. wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price. Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs, one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price.	They decide to make two designs, one more advanced than the other.
I suggest we start the meeting uh without Matthew uh he's uh obviously late for some reason. Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design. I hope uh you both did some uh some work uh concerning a uh conceptual design. Um this will be the uh agenda for the meeting uh. Uh I will take some minutes uh again. Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members, and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented. we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh.	Then the project manager opens the meeting announcing that they will address conceptual design and then giving the agenda.
It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there. It needs to stand out. It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment. we need to have something that looks interesting, that looks exciting, that will stand out. That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want. That's a really cool feature, Third on the list, and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect, it has to be easy to use. So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um.	She emphasizes that the remote needs to be exciting, contain a cool feature, and be somewhat intuitive.
do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready? I think yeah the Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here there is Matthew. this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment. we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it. We basically used um some focus group surveys and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um, The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really. The most important by far was the look and feel of it.	Matthew arrives late and the marketing expert begins her presentation about trends.
Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones, a lot of them have the changeable covers, so they can choose what colour the outside is. Textured feel we just talked about. So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture, a spongy one or a soft one or something like that. Yeah that's a very good idea, yeah. still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality, the way the mobile phones work, the way the keypad looks. Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost, There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't I don't think, in my personal opinion, gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them. I think we're better doing something basic like this and very will be a really cool feature to put in. maybe we just, the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe, by themselves, and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate. Yes the the the there are changeable covers, but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational we can afford to have two or three different designs at least. I mean those covers could go for for three, five Euro.	She lists ideas such as changable covers, a locator, speech recognition, and LCD screens.
Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment, uh fruit and vegetables um. This is basically talking about just the the feel of it, so probably not the smell of it, but the bright colours, um eye-catching, really bold designs, and a spongy feel. Um I had a talk to the design people about this, but having a remote that's tactile, that feels different, that would be really cool. can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said? spongy is the current thing. Spongy is the current texture, but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all, so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something, that'll be something that sets it apart, rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment. going with the fruit and vegetable idea, we've got the bright colours, so makes it stand out, the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours, part of the fruit and vegetables um.	She reports that currently fruits and vegetables are fashionable- thus bright eye-catching colors, bold designs, and a spongy feel is appropriate.
I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_, rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad. because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly, There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information, names, if you have a multiple functionality, say T_V_, V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the T_V_, and you can programme the keys if you want to, certain keys are even the channel information. In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing, eighty word, which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement, like eighty to hundred word. Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control, you want to st store your favourite channel. Maybe ten channels, yeah at the most. I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote, instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having, um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition. I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine, and so if you say hello coffee machine, it say hi Joe, or something like that, But a coffee machine, there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary. so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing, and very isolated word and it's uh it is interesting, and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys, on the display for the browsing	He likes the idea of implenting speech recognition into a universal remote.
then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures, different forms, and uh they could be like buttons and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other, and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button. So what I have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the T_V_, V_C_R_, music system operated ones actually, for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie, and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is now, for example I can use a simple toggle switch, and a display, so I press it so the display says, okay, I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is, instead of having three keys separately for four keys, there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them, and you can operate them. and maybe having something like a blinking thing, like uh it could indicate you're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote, the blinking. At the same time, if it's a dark room, it can be used to locate the remote also y you want to let the user to programming the keys? Some of them? Yeah you can let them to do that. And uh isn't that too difficult I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to	The industrial specialist presents, talking about how a remote typically has different keys, structures and forms.
what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control, and how is it manufactured h what is the process, just to explain you. there is a a set of components in a in a remote control the the components in themself do not cost a lot there are two uh different types of uh um Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control. Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver. the other components and the circuit board buttons, infrared, led, etcetera, for the components just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed, and then it translate to the key, to a sequence, something like morse code, as you know, uh with a different sequence for each key, electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble. I think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology, and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them. my personal design we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use. If it's plastic m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but, with the changeable covers to fancy it up. So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in, for instance, a wooden case. they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons, a scroll wheels, integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse. And uh very cheap	The industrial designer presents about remote control components and the manufacturing process, listing options such as various buttons, scroll wheels, integrated push buttons like those in a computer mouse, and LCDs.  They discuss the project budget and the possibility of using an expensive chip.
Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices, if you're using speech recognition or something like that.	The marketing expert will look for the cost inventories of other devices, such as speech recognition.
because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents. I'm sorry to have Every time I have to come down on this price again so this might be a little limiting for your creativity, do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition, I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the I would say that for programming uh keys, you said, uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros, i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented, and w how much it's cost, maybe with a f cheap chip.	They discuss without certainity about the cost of such functions.
I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting. Ju just make two designs, and the we we can decide decide between th those designs. Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices, if you're using speech recognition or something like that. is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting? uh, I don't know whether that's possible, maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow. is this me designing a way to evaluate it I don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time but a as far as possible. One for like cost and the one with like higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them let's call this to an end.	The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what his/her tasks will be until the next meeting.
you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes	The industial and interface designer will work together on the two prototypes (one cost-effective and one higher-end).
maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow.	She will also start evaluating the team's work if possible.
We can give them smooth keys, The the problem most of the time we've seen, the keys is that it's small, for example, as I was if you make them big, it may change the look of the thing also to the people. and not too m too many keys of course yeah.	They decide that the keys on the remote should be smooth, big, and there should not be too many.
and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email.	They will recieve further instructions by email.
when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget, uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip, I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know. do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better. wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price. Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs, one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price.	They are not certain if the project budget will allow them to use the more expensive chip, so they decided to make two prototypes so that they can compare them and possibly find a compromise.
Uh, plastic would be the material.	Made of plastic.
Double curve.	The remote will be double-curved.
this would this would be cutting the speech recognition. and we still on fifteen, And what about the number of buttons buttons uh my Matthew? when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty. But that's seven basic buttons right, seven buttons without any adds-on, without special colours or form or material. So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget, Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact, you have a big display Or we could even replace them by buttons actually. I think, unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display. Okay so we can get rid of it and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display, there's no way we can get it in there. I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen. That that's that's my opinion. So hav hav having seven buttons, instead of twelve. The speech recognition is out. Because of the budget, yeah. are we basically back to the original one now, back to the first version?	They eliminated many of the features of the advanced version, eventually bringing them near to the basic.
maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually.	The energy source will be a normal AA battery.
and we still on fifteen, We we really want a L_C_D_ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market. So wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L_C_D_, um Or we could even replace them by buttons actually. Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact, you have a big display I think, unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display. Okay so we can get rid of it and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display, there's no way we can get it in there. S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it? I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening. I can't see it fitting in. I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen. That that's that's my opinion.	It was a long and tedious process, taking much time for them to reach an agreement since some felt an LCD screen was necessary and others did not.
for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons, and then add a couple of buttons.	Addition of two buttons.
and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price,	Production cost 12 Euros, 50 cents cheaper than budget.
given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip. I think yeah regular, today we you can do that with regular chip.	Will contain a regular chip.
Okay so we can get rid of it I think, unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display. The speech recognition is out. Because of the budget, yeah.	Have no LCD screen or speech recognition.
and then you have a power button, which l volume, what you have, and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo Play, pause. yeah s pause or stop, you have a L_C_D_ display, here and uh y this is a functional thing which can change it's a toggle switch which could change the function From D_V_D_ player to television or something. and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ you can have a integrated microphone over here, This is the orange button, the microphone. you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display. And here is a small L_E_D_ which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery, and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier then we have a cover when you need you can use it, and this gives additional functionality but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed, will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen? Yeah. Actually when you are watching the T_V_, when you are watching anything or listening to them, you hardly care about what is getting displayed here, and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually, giving a cover to that actually. Gives a protection It's low weight. You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight. if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys we should stick with uh a number of keys it it should not be cluttering up everything. I like the shape of them, I do like the the size and the the shape.	It also has a power button, channel up/down, slow pause/slow stop, LCD screen, toggle switch that changes it from audio to video, and microphone.
So the the cost is actually a bit more, Sixteen Euros. So it's well outside the budget then. But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer. And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item Three Euros. That's on top of the sixteen, or is it part of that? part of that, yeah. So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition.	It would cost 16 Euros to produce, which is out of the budget.
the on-off button, in red. Here would be the volume. On the on the left, so you can go up and down the channels, uh, if you have a video or something you can forward, back. How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_, by the way? this is a standard T_V_ one, and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits. The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel. And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that. Actually. It's a very basic minimal thing Exce except for the for the special shape, the surfing board, it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh.	It contains an on-off button, volume switch, up/down channel function, 10 digits, and two extra buttons for teletext and an additional function.
uh i i i it is a very futuristic, it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future, it can come. Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone. then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality, uh in this way, uh th you see there are only six keys, they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here. And so they have more space actually and uh it's easy to uh use this	The next control is futuristic because feels like a mobile phone, has 6 keys, and is smooth.
Matthew is uh late again. it is important for him to be here uh. but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer. I think we can put on the here. we will just we just have to continue. just for record I I will take uh notes again. first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents. when you stay in it's good, when you don't stay in you have to redesign. maybe Anna, you can have your presentation. we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design. Matthew. Nice uh you are here. we we designed the two uh items.	As the meeting opens the project manager tells the group that they must stay within the budget of twelve Euro and fifty cents or will have to redesign.
we we designed the two uh items.	The group created two design prototypes to choose from.
Thank you. That was it. Thanks.	They close the meeting by thanking one another.
ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs. I will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually, right, seven eight Euros, first for both they have um a special shape, but uh it's like a surf board. And also it's not too far from um a mobile. So people are used to that kind of shape, Don't take care too much about the colour Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now.	After Matthew arrives the designers begin presenting the two prototypes, beginning with the basic conventional one which is shaped like a surfboard and costs 7 or 8 Euros to produce.
Because, when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap.	When they rated both products, they found that the basic version was not innovative enough but the advanced version was too costly.
w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment.	Will talk to the suppliers to see if they can lower prices and add a few more features.
Which turns out to be on budget exactly, pretty much. With these new costings. and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price, My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected.	After choosing features their remote costs 12 Euros to produce.
Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible, maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products, both of these two. and also the evaluation criteria, so what what is important to look at. it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product. Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that, These are the things we identified as being important. Um the three things were look and feel, innovation and ease of use, were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic. And then goin following the company motto, following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well. do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them? why not why not discuss uh discuss it now, just go through onto the whiteboard I guess. look and feel, innovation And now it easy to use. you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these? w w we can still discuss that. and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas um I've received uh a framework which we can do this. this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components, so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh. Th th this is the first design. Um w one's bad and seven's the best. one's true and seven's false. Look and feel. In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good, is very good in your hand, so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even	The marketing expert gives the product evaluation and they rate them on look and feel, innovation, ease of use, appeal to the correct demographic, and adherence to the company motto and fashion trends.
it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out. Because, when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive or we just have to choose. And adapt. That'll basically take us down to the budget. Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip, uh Matthew, so maybe we have to recap with this one. and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap. let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet, Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this, yeah. uh what kind of energy source uh It's a it's a normal battery, or maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually. given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip. Uh sample speaker, yeah. Double curve. Uh, plastic would be the material. Are you talking about this or that? but they have the same shape, Uh special colour, now we leave it to the covers. now we're either going button or L_C_D_s, L_C_D_ display. It's okay. Just say L_C_D_. So it would need twelve buttons. we might need a scroll wheel, right, for that? but for this one it's twelve Euro. So this comes to eighteen. And that's without any special button supplements. we'd have a special colour, special form and special material on all of them. it's not it's not double curved, it's single curved, it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well, that's what I thought. we've got those the scroll wheel on the side I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure. The bt buttons, we have twelve buttons, are you sure? We've got a scroll wheel for the volume this is even more than the um than the cost you gave, the sixteen Euros. That is the sample sensor and sample speaker. We just need that actually. We need one. We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip, but then we	They discuss the energy source, shape, chip type, LCD and speech recognition, and additional buttons.
Okay so welcome everyone. So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control. So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff, then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it. And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process. So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original, we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly. So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points. First it will be the functional design. Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design. So the functional design is to identify the main user needs, the technical function the remote control should fulfil. And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved, what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that. And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point.	The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave a timeline for the project.
So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board. It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan. Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost. It's a cat. Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow.	The group trained themselves to use the meeting room tools by drawing on the whiteboard.
So Here the uh financial objective of our project. That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros. Yeah if it's trendy, original I d fulfil the user needs.	The Project Manager presented the project budget and the projected price point and profit goals.
Okay, so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device. But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well. Maybe we can sell uh all that together, so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well.	The group would like the remote to control multiple devices and have optional water and other damage protection.
so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple. Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device, otherwise it could be programmable one And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil? If we don't have so many buttons could be nice. And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark? Something which is not squarey maybe uh, not a box. So. Fit in your hand, yeah. Water-proof as well. Maybe water-proof would be very original. And, and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it. But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well. Maybe we can sell uh all that together, so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well. most of the time I I lose my remote control. We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping. Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep. That's a good idea, that's very original and that's can uh improve. So i it's just going to add t to the cost. Yeah. We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer. Okay so try to find that for next meeting.	The group discussed several of their initial ideas for the features of the product.
That's a good idea, that's very original and that's can uh improve. Yeah. We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer. Okay so try to find that for next meeting.	The group will research the possibility of integrating a locator function into the design.
Okay, so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device. Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device, otherwise it could be programmable one so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple. Water-proof as well. Maybe water-proof would be very original. And, and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it. But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well. Maybe we can sell uh all that together, so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well. most of the time I I lose my remote control. We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping. Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep. That's a good idea, that's very original and that's can uh improve. So i it's just going to add t to the cost. Yeah. We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer. Okay so try to find that for next meeting.	They discussed making the remote able to control multiple devices, protection from water or from dropping the remote, and a locator function.
So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed. So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons, the the fact that is lighted or not, things like that, and what would be convenient for the user. And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements, what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user. and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon.	The Project Manager then instructed the User Interface Designer to research users' requirements, and instructed the Industrial and User Interface Designers to research the functions and usability features that were discussed in the meeting.
Okay so try to find that for next meeting. So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed.	The Industrial Designer will do research on the whistle tracking locator function and other functional components.
So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons, the the fact that is lighted or not, things like that, and what would be convenient for the user.	The User Interface Designer will research the necessary amount of buttons and the lighted interface that were discussed during the meeting and other usability features.
And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements, what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user.	The Marketing Expert will research users' requirements for a remote control device.
in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot. Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control. F not many buttons, and uh and uh uh u useable buttons. so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use. We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel. Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the So as we say before, I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing.	The Marketing Expert went over users' requirements as seen in a company study and showed that the major complaint was that remotes were too difficult to use.
So um the question well first of all what to control. So most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that. and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house. so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that, uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff. the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever. Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah. so the user interface will consist of two parts. Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices, a set of buttons for special navigation in space, a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access. Like a video tape goes forward, backwards, uh fast and stuff yeah. For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah? and also parameter changing. So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic Voice command w we could specify anything. We could assign any button a command to any button, if we have enough processing power,	The User Interface Designer presented the major components of the interface design, dividing the interface into two parts: voice commands and buttons.
Maybe we can include that also. Previous previous channel button. So have a wheel for incremental, have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed I would say the wheel is better.	The group decided to include a previous channel change button to the standard remote buttons, and to have a wheel for changing channels in increments, with a smaller number pad below it.
And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process Yeah. That would be cool. But eight months is really long	The remote will not include speech recognition.
We have a technical problem uh. Otherwise, could you just describe by hand? With the the whiteboard? Um I dunno if you can open the Short-cut to AMI shared folder? Maybe you can send it to me by email. I will try to show it to everyone, but I think we have some technical problem or so. So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control.	The group experienced many technical difficulties with their presentations; all participants encountered problems when opening their presentations.
So few buttons, channel, volume control Maybe switch T_V_ on and off I discovered that when I did a quick look, uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now, you have a button, you you press it, and this is uh the previous channel which has come back. How should they how should we implement that? This is uh incremental, but once you press it for a long time, you go five by five. Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one. I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this. Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel. not a a wheel but a ball, I would say the wheel is better. and do we put an L_C_D_ display? If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_. Just increase the cost. So no L_C_D_? And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process Yeah. That would be cool. But eight months is really long	The group decided on what button functions should be included and decided to eliminate the LCD screen and voice recognition from the design due to time and cost restraints.
If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_. So no L_C_D_?	The remote will not have an LCD screen.
but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important.	The Project Manager announced a new requirement to the group, that the remote is only to control televisions.
Uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks. Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy. so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly And uh remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah. for the younger it's very important To have L_C_D_ and voice. and speech recognition. And uh and the others is not so important	She also showed that users want fancier and more ergonomic designs, shock protection, voice recognition, and LCD screens.
so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users, And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product.	The Project Manager announced also that the group was not to include a teletext function and that they should integrate the company logo into the external design.
Basically we have a a battery a power supply here. After that we just have um user interface. which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button, something like that. Push button or a L_C_D_. After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip. So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component. Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that. So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition. I would say uh about eight months to have the first results. Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip. and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want?	The Industrial Designer gave a layout of the internal functions of the device and showed that a standard chip, instead of a larger one that would accomodate voice recognition, would be the most feasible.
Well the obvious thing is a banana, I guess. Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then. but when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top and to control, You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company. So we will just use a a standard battery? I think it's the box that should be spongy, banana's shape.	They decided to make the remote shaped like a banana and spongy, to have the buttons lighted, to have a wheel sensor at the top of the device, and to use only a standard chip and battery that would not accomodate speech recognition.
I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well. I think we can keep the wheel	The group finalized which features they wanted to integrate into the design.
So we will just use a a standard battery?	The remote will use standard batteries.
So, maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form And the mm the material is expected to be spongy. I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing, Yeah, because it's robust. Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh, things like that. Yeah. Maybe pear yeah or something like that.	A fruit and vegetable theme and spongy materials are popular trends that will be used in the design.
And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends, uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes, and furnitures. So, maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form And the mm the material is expected to be spongy.	The Marketing Expert presented news about trends in fashion and in the market that will be incorporated into the design.
but when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top and to control,	It will be placed at the top of the banana shape.
And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler. We have all these buttons as you can see, but most of them, we just need the ones in the middle. With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part. I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb. Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way. Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case.	He showed how the new design will be more simple and ergonomic than the models he displayed by eliminating extra functions.
I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has. that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible. but when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top and to control,	The group decided to keep the wheel sensor despite the added cost.
So I just look at some current designs uh on the web, of usually more complicated remote controls. And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple. So it's basically more or less how we would like it, with a big volume control, big channel control, and mute and power, So basically, w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two.	The User Interface Designer presented existing remote controls to help show the interface of the prototype.
you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control. The push button are usually extremely cheap, but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor, which seems to be quite expensive. And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button. Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button. So will will will this with uh including all possible things, so buttons, wheel and the chip, be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce? We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money. the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button, We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button. Um, what is the purpose of the light? You can easily find the button in the dark or so? As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light. I don't think that this is really expensive, Yeah, but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so, But it can be uh battery consuming, no? To have the light always on? Yeah, a little bit.	The Industrial Designer presented the functional components that will appear in the prototype, and discussed with the group the high cost of the wheel sensor and the possibility of incorporating speech recognition.
Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then. You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company. I think it's the box that should be spongy, banana's shape.	The remote will be shaped and colored like a banana, and be covered in a spongy material.
I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well. I think we can keep the wheel chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use.	The group decided on the features that will be incorporated into the design of the prototype.
And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros. which is uh good, because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros. for the financial aspect it's okay, we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if,	The final cost was under the alotted budget; the Project Manager announced that the project could then continue with the current prototype.
let's start with the cost aspect I look at the aspect discussed last time, that is to say uh to have a standard battery, to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it uh to feel spongy, and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera. And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros.	The Project Manager presented the final cost of the remote with the finalized list of components.
fancy look and feel, what do you think? between o one and seven. I give it a I give it a five. So I think it's uh very uh very nice. it's between one and seven? Seven is the highest uh? Seven is the I will give a six. I will give a a five. Maybe we all have to agree on a common uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or we can choose what we want. let's say that seven is the best. do note the grade we have five, six for me, How much would you give on the fancy aspect, on the fashionable aspect? I think six, it's a good uh So it will have five point five average. after, the technological aspect? we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel. We also have the rubber material, I think I would give a five. It's four. A four also, because, except for the wheel, we don't have so much innovation. are we including the voice in the end or not? Huh? No. Yeah, four. Four, yeah, let's put four. Very easy to use. Do you think it's easy to use? I give a seven, I think. Mm, six for me also. six point five. Is it fashion? its its f its fruit fruit shape. I would say seven. Yeah it's fashion, we can we can put a seven here. Easy to find. I think you can't miss it. I think it's cool. We have the lightning, So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely, I would say seven. Is it is it robust? it's rubber, made of rubber, the only problem there might be which know, i if it's very sensitive, But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material. So maybe we can put a six. Everybody is okay, six. We have to sum up everything. Six is a good Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better	The group evaluated the prototype based on the requirements of users presented in the first meetings.
and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert. I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings. we have uh six points. we we want to have a product fancy look and feel, technologically innovative, easy to use, fashion, easy to find in a room, and robust, I have a scale of uh seven points. I go through all the uh all the points here, and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point, two point or seven point. And after we ha we have an an average, and uh we see.	The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype to the group.
and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product, I think. So it's a good evaluation, I think. We have a good price So this prototype is quite nice. So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive, I think.	The group decided that the prototype met enough of these goals to be able to market the product.
for the financial aspect it's okay, And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros. we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if, We have a good price and so we could sell at twenty five Euros We we have the cost below uh our threshold The the the financial aspect were okay. and make i make profit.	The group decided that the final cost of the prototype was low enough that they could continue with the current prototype and still meet the profit goals.
we have seen the prototype. It's very nice according to the work of our two designer. The the the financial aspect were okay. We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit. The the evaluation give satisfying result as well. the cost is in the budget, the evaluation is okay, so I th I think we can now uh open champagne Congratulations to the team. Uh very well, we worked together fantastically. I think it was a good collaboration uh.	The Project Manager summarized the accomplishments of the meeting.
So it's a good evaluation, I think. and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product, I think. So this prototype is quite nice. The the evaluation give satisfying result as well.	The group also decided that the design of the prototype was satisfactory and met enough of the users' requirements to be able to be marketed.
Uh did you all receive that email? So does anyone have any overall Well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext, people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext, and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now. What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated, some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity that's presented, I guess. Right. Yeah. No, I I agree with you. So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is, what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television. So we're quite fixed. So we're really probably, in terms of marketing, are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product. So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we people use our remote with. So it's kind of a stupid decision. we really have to innovate here I guess. 'Cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext. 'cause somebody, some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext. It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring? I think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward. Obviously the the w it has to be branded. So then the double R_ will be our our Can you handle that black and yellow? I think w, yeah, one of the things	The Project Manager reviewed new requirements for the project with the group and discussed their implementation.
So we're quite fixed. Well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext, people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext, and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now. So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we people use our remote with. So it's kind of a stupid decision. It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring? So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include, it really should be in there. Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that, I guess, But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it. But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities. I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext, Yeah, and neither do I in fact. a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that, although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price. Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of. I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext. I don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh, do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss? beca I I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now. If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s, V_C_R_s and everything, then I can see the market niche, because who wants just	The group felt constrained by the new project requirements and had difficulties implementing the management's directives.
So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include, it really should be in there. just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands. I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext, I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext.	The group decided that they want to incorporate teletext despite the management's directive.
Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip	There was a lack of information about the cost of components and materials.
we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be Well, see I I see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product. Let's make this thing really exclusive, environmentally sensitive, uh high-tech design, uh ergonomics, all of this. I just don't know about that, because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate, you know, the D_V_D_ player and, you know, the stereo system and all that. Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of. I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext. But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have. They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want, and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate. I don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh, do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss? beca I I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now. I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote. I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s, yeah, 'cause it's selling on its own. All you need to do is train them to the individual one, they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions. If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s, V_C_R_s and everything, then I can see the market niche, because who wants just a television remote? If you're in the market for this ultimate	The group continued to discuss the marketing strategy for the device as it would not include many advanced technological functions; they discussed including a guarantee for the remote and using a unique form factor.
And it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive, and it may even fit into ergonomics, and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote, what we were saying it's a common issue. Um what we can do is, well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy. Right? Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle? Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it, and we can, instead of having instead of having, you know, replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote. 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote, I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design You know you could have some kind of neat little, you know, a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself. I like the idea, but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double. And you could page the remote if you lose it. Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per? No no. No no, we have t we have to change the end cost. We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh Can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelve-fifty per product, if we basically can sell more based on this? I my reaction is no, but what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down. It i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair, and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user. it would last for several hours on its own power, but when you're done with it you put	The Industrial Designer proposed including a battery charging stand with the device but it was decided that it was not a useful feature.
but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double. But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent.	The group does not want to include the battery charging stand.
Onto participant four. 'til you spoke and when I wrote this, I don't know what I'm marketing. I just know that I I was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer, as a manufacturer, and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers. And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price. Um so what I did is I I decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself. We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is. Um so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily. so having something beauty, something attractive, uh something that in a sense will sell itself. Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design. Uh cutting edge technology, I don't think we're gonna have that, um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned. I I talked about environmentally sensitive, uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home. Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation, that we're new, we're aggressive, we're competitive, we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line. So to me it's about selling d uh our identity our corporate identity along with the product. Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market, but again, because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations, I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing.	The Marketing Expert discussed his marketing strategy for the project, again stressing the attractiveness of the product design.
But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it. Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that, I guess, So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include, it really should be in there. I mean even if it's necessary or not, if you if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it, it can be operated with the same set of buttons, yeah? i it's just uh the cost of an extra button. I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext. I I don't understand how those two things are connected. How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other? Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example. the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities. I just I don't see the cross-over between computers and television. I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense, but but but but with the the remote is is used for television, okay. Well there there is a for example on digital T_V_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts, They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers, Yeah, and there's other features for example on other systems where you	The group discussed not being able to include a teletext component, and that the product design would have to be the main selling point of the device.
So yeah function design. what I found is we want to do fashion and I think, honestly, we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design. basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good. Um something cute and small. The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties. And um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to, for instance, tune in their the stations. There's no need to have that in the remote. um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design, and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo, but um we should go for the user-oriented device, so simple controls and good ergonomics. Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that, I guess,	The User Interface Designer stressed that the project should focus on a simple design for the device.
So depending on what we want our functionality to be, um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap. Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power.	He showed that the size of the chip they will use is dependent on how many complicated functions are included.
I'm the Industrial Designer. And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need, just basically every remote'll need 'em. We need some kinda of power d power source. Um we have to decide on our our user interface, which is his department, but the in user interface is also a major component. Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal, which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_, which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal. You need a on-off switch And uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s. So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well. Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work. You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there, and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing, and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor. We're talking about existing technology. this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote. We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition, I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip. Do we have an idea of costs of different components? Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well. Um the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty	The Industrial Designer presented the basic components of a remote control device and how they work together.
So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle? Do we go basic or do we go for features? Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first? Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do? Yeah. Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do. now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons. So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique. What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make. if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it, but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down. No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh dock to put it in to to charge it. We can target like environmentally friendly ideas, that sorta things. It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle. What type of casing? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber. I'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens, you know, and then it's not really rubber where there's you have plastic bits but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside. or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_? d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons, Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake and all you're doing I mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television, so the	The group had a discussion to decide on the product features.
Trend watching I guess. When I s when I see the when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it. There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there. Are you talking about the picture? That's not our that's not our b design, Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet. And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now. Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand. Uh I like the idea of of the scroll what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different. I give me a lower price, give me a higher price, give me some new technology, when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's I'd I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though, the then we have that as well, Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior, Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here. so what I'm saying is, from my perspective, I don't have a product to market right now. Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost, either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology. Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet. If you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost.	The Marketing Expert expressed concern that the remote lacked enough features to be distinctive.
So right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel. We want a mode indicator. We want back-lit buttons. Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range. Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip, sorta thing or for	They decided to include a charging stand, to use a thin rubber casing material, to include a locator function and a scroll wheel with two channel-changing options to increase its usability.
Oh interface concept. our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition. They say they could put it to work but um we don't think so. It it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and I mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show, it's gonna change the channel. But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize? Well then why don't you just press the up button? Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_. I think it's a bad idea frankly.	The User Interface Designer discussed voice recognition with the group, and the group decided to not use it in their design.
So right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel. We want a mode indicator. Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber, robust, with scroll wheel, with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff, favourite channels, and and with a cradle, and yeah and the locator.	A scroll wheel will be included for the channel-changing function, and will allow users to switch between scrolling through pre-programmed favorite channels and through all channels.
For electronics, we have these very technical um descriptions here. A simple chip, which is the least expensive, a regular chip, which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip? but I have no numbers to give you, A simple chip is required to operate push buttons. Um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display, and it didn't say specifically, but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels. That's the end of my presentation.	He displayed the three options for chips.
Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber, robust, with scroll wheel, with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff, favourite channels, and and with a cradle, and yeah and the locator. but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside. Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip, sorta thing or for	The device will be covered in a thin rubber casing.
Well, we wanna small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed, but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost, But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that. Somehow. Um so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without with a l a less complicated um design, so the numbers, the volume control, and channel control, and teletext access. Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial. And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext. So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume? i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross, um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized, so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost.	He discussed the size of the device and the layout of the interface, and suggested that the remote be moderately sized to prevent its getting lost.
With a cradle, radio transmitters, and back-lit buttons.	The remote will feature back-lit buttons.
Yeah so um taking that away, our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it	He suggested using rubber buttons because of their durability.
Yeah, I was gonna say thirty five to fifty. Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay.	The projected price point will be changed to a point between thirty-five and fifty Euros.
So here are options for our power sources. You can use a basic battery, which we've already discussed, um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that. So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy, so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it. Uh we've got solar cells, which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea. Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here? I like the kinetic. Well it is it is more uh I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do. Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic, a rubber latex type thing, uh wood, or titanium. If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche, wouldn't it. I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote, whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it. Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell, to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable, The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape But basically these are curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department, in their um in their message to me, that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom. I have no idea exactly what they're talking about, but	He discussed energy source and material options, and suggested that using rubber and plastic would be the most versatile option.
Components design. So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control. Um you've got a printed a printed uh circuit board here, and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate So you've also got um you've got your chip here, your batteries here, and some sorta electronics. Um so you've got here's here's a transistor, and this amplifies your signal, um you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board. Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot. So um we've got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here, this is a eighteen pin um uh chip I dunno. Uh it's two double A_ batteries. This is pretty standard remote.	The Industrial Designer presented an overview of the internal components of a remote control device.
I think it's a bad idea frankly.	The remote will not feature voice recognition.
Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will construct the prototype.
Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber, robust, with scroll wheel, with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff, favourite channels, and and with a cradle, and yeah and the locator. I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator, I think those are two very strong features,	A locator function will also be included.
Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber, robust, with scroll wheel, with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff, favourite channels, and and with a cradle, and yeah and the locator. With a cradle, radio transmitters, and back-lit buttons. I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator, I think those are two very strong features,	The group decided to include a charging stand to help users keep track of their remote.
but I have no numbers to give you, I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be, though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components. So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to,	There was a lack of information on the cost of components.
Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to construct the prototype.
There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there. Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand. or do we really need the scroll wheel as well? and I guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product, Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost.	The group had difficulty finding a balance between keeping the project cost low and adding enough features to make the product distinctive.
though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components. So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to, I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached, I would say thirty five to forty. Yeah, I was gonna say thirty five to fifty. Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay. Let's let's try and think now, how much would you pay for But you've gotta think who our target market is Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber, robust, with scroll wheel, with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff, favourite channels, and and with a cradle, and yeah and the locator.	The group discussed the cost of the various components and decided to sell the device at a point between thirty-five and fifty Euros.
No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it. These cables suck. and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works. Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice. And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon.	The group had difficulties with their computers and much of the meeting-room equipment.
we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess,	The group felt that they had room to be creative, but only after they changed the initial specifications.
The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only. There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things, so they keep it, they don't take it back. Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable?	The Marketing Expert was still concerned that the remote would only be used for televisions.
Not the original budget, but they are now.	The group was satisfied enough with the prototype and the final production cost to continue with the current prototype.
Are the costs within the budget? Not the original budget, but they are now.	They were satisfied with the increased final cost and budget.
So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote. Beep beep beep. but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there.	They demonstrated how the locator function operates.
And um there's one other feature that we were debating, but we decided to go against it, we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling,	They suggested that a trigger button should be included in a later designing phase to improve the feel of the product.
Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department, which is us, is uh fifteen point eight Euros, we implemented the basic functions, which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator, cradle, scroll wheel for uh the the channels, and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping, your favourite channels functionality, in the scroll. Scrolling through your favourites list. I like the the the the logo on there as well. Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here, so this is the cradle unit, This is the teletext. So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use. So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here, and the red area is like a rubber covering. and the buttons are all gonna be rubber, so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it? Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem, but if you drop it I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well. but I think we might scale down the final model a bit. So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote. Beep beep beep. And um there's one other feature that we were debating, but we decided to go against it, we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there. And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling, So maybe in a final design	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype to the group and displayed all of its components.
Okay so we can talk about finance now. So I have a little spreadsheet for us I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros, which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already. Uh and I'm assuming that the locator beacon, uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display, um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print, we only need the uh the regular chip on print, Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved? So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four. See it's a little bit more than f single-curved. So yeah it's fifteen point eight, we haven't talked about any special colour though if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll? That's a scroll. then we have fifteen point eight Euros. I think we we ended up being quite creative there.	The Project Manager discussed the final production cost with the group; after an analysis of all of the components the final cost was 15.8 Euros.
It's single-curved, We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation, How how have we done today? I think we did pretty well. No, I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept. Okay so th th what about um room for creativity? Sh I think there was plenty of room. I think we we ended up being quite creative there. we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess, It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was These cables suck. So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works. What new ideas have we found? Well we had the favourites list, and the scroll bar, and we have the cradle, and the r uh remote call feature. Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice. And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon. Are the costs within the budget? Not the original budget, but they are now.	The Project Manager then led a discussion about the group's experience on the project.
I gotta do mine up at the board. So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it. And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh. And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market. We've got the features, we have the uh characteristics, The the corporation stands behind the product, okay. we've got you know the features that make this a unique product. Um we have reliability, we have comfort, we have ergonomics, we have environmentally s sensitive. One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product, a normal use guarantee, it has the features and the characteristics, and the background, I believe, to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros. We're gonna be competitive, and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche. would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could, but lowering our profit margins? for my evaluation, based on what our competition is, I th I think that that we can go after this and at that cost I think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together. The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only. There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things, so they keep it, they don't take it back. Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable? W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff, but Yeah	The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the product and felt that it satisfied his criteria.
One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product, a normal use guarantee, The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only. There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things, so they keep it, they don't take it back. Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable? W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff, but Yeah, the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well, or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons,	He suggested including a lifetime guarantee and expressed concern that the remote would only be used for televisions.
Sh I think there was plenty of room. we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess, It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was	The group felt that they worked well together and that they had room to be creative, but only after they changed many of the initial specifications.
These cables suck. and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works. Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice. And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon.	They also had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment.
The tool training is to try out the white board, Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard, Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics. I don't know if we have to do it now, maybe later later. There was a step about drawing something in the in the board, Are we supposed to do right now? You can draw something which is very simple. It's a It's a cat. you have to draw a rat if you want a rat. It's a rabbit. Right. A fish.	Then the team participated in an exercise in which they all drew animals.
the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros. I think it's quite good price, yeah. And not too expensive.	The remote will not be too expensive.
it will uh be a an international remote control, so really the remote control to be international.	The remote will have international appeal.
I'm Ada Longmund, and as you may know it, I'm the pr project manager. Our project project is to create um a new remote control so the remote control has to be original, trendy and um user-friendly. if we're um the functional design, you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other. Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design. Uh. the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros. it will uh be a an international remote control, I think it's quite good price, yeah. and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes. try to create something new And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes, you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications. Those things just refer to each of each of us, I think. AMI I_D_ is for the Industrial Design, And U_I_D_, it's for the User Interface Designer, I will manage all all the group. and Marketing Expert, it's me. what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design? I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it. I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the uh industrial design, it is how the object will look like. Maybe, it is the outside and the inside. 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be, you know. I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial	The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and discussed the roles of each member and the selling price for the remote they will produce.
Those things just refer to each of each of us, I think. AMI what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design? I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it. I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the uh industrial design, it is how the object will look like. Maybe, it is the outside and the inside. 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be, you know.	The difference between the role of the industrial designer and the role of the user interface designer.
try to create something new And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now.	The remote will have new functions that existing remotes do not have.
As you all know, you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control. I propose a nifra infrared base I think it's cheaper than laser, so. what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just, you know a bulb and an infrared bulb, I have some kind of pictures and you have the other subcomponent There's a wire with remote control? I think it should be wire wireless re remote con and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you. So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea. maybe it will be cheaper I dunno but as Industrial Designer, do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television? Do you think it will be cheaper? Could you answer please? Have to think about the question, but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem. Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it? I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television,	The Industrial Designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and presented options for components and materials which would keep costs low.
The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control. remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions, so we want to design uh elegant, easy to use inter interface. A very good example is Google. So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface. So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful. With sophisticated functions, and very easy to use. it's maybe difficult to have both, I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it. but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system, alright.	The User Interface Designer discussed  some characteristics and functions to consider in designing the remote and introduced an idea for giving the remote international appeal by merging it with a system such as Google.
You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon Component component, yeah.	The Industrial Designer will conduct further research into components.
but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to, you know, connect to internet, you know, surf the web. There's that box in the T_V_, so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_. I don't think it's popular, I think it has to be yellow. I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_. Or should be. Doesn't need to be completely yellow,	The team then discussed different features they could include in the design of the remote.
new information about the product requirements, the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore, because now everybody has internet at home, and also the remote control will only be used for television, you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that. So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it, to have very powerful and easy. which will be used for for the television, for the recorder, for the camcorder and all the others, it will become too complex And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product, such as the colour and s the slogan. So has to be yellow. As we say, we put the fashion in electronics, Require lot of requirements, Regarding the first line, what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext. But I dunno, but why, I think it would be simpler.	The project manager introduced the new requirements for the project.
the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore, so it's better to use internet then teletext. because now everybody has internet at home,	Teletext will not be used.
So just trying to answer all the questions, We had one hundred subjects, um, we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire, um, Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly, Yeah, the the look is is bad for them Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly. And then um yeah, the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime, because it's too many buttons and so on. And uh users are actually zapping a lot, ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control. remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people. And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users. R_S_I_ is like, when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times, then you get injured. Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs. If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent, And definitely if it could have less buttons, still maybe the same number of um functions, but less buttons, And just to have uh an idea, do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control, you think it's possible? Yeah, I think possible. Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button. but do you think it will be easy to use? Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know. you you can have a switch menu, but it has to be intuitive	The Marketing Expert presented consumer preferences and requirements.
and also the remote control will only be used for television, you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that.	The remote will only be used for televisions.
And definitely if it could have less buttons, still maybe the same number of um functions, but less buttons,	The remote should not have too many buttons.
If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent,	The remote should look fancy.
and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept.	The User Interface Designer will work on the interface concept
And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product, such as the colour and s the slogan.	The corporate logo should be recognizable on the product.
And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product, such as the colour and s the slogan.	The corporate color must be featured on the product.
As we say, we put the fashion in electronics, so it has to be a fashion remote control. Fancy, fashion, powerful, easy to use.	The remote has to be fashionable.
There's a wire with remote control? I think it should be wire wireless re remote con and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you. So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea. maybe it will be cheaper I dunno but as Industrial Designer, do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television? Do you think it will be cheaper? Could you answer please? Have to think about the question, but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem. Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it? I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television,	Whether to have a wireless remote or one which is linked by a cable to the television.
And just to have uh an idea, do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control, you think it's possible? Yeah, I think possible. Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button. but do you think it will be easy to use? Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know. you you can have a switch menu, but it has to be intuitive. For example, if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder. so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot.	How to have a highly functional and powerful remote while minimizing the number of buttons.
I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control. Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options, I think it has to be yellow. I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_. Or should be. Doesn't need to be completely yellow,	What colors the remote should come in.
I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first, Mister David Jordan. Um there's three concepts in the user interface. So first one it's a Google controller. The second is a fancy controller. The last one is uh intelligent controller. I want the controller to be easy to use, but with sophisticated functions. the first is Google controller. The second concept is a fancy controller, we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive, the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute, very very g um Such like this, there are several uh examples in the slides. I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive. We'll have big discussion I suppose after that, the last uh concept is intelligent. so maybe we should uh use um uh technology, such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology, so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition. Um With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user. stick to the first two parts. So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market? so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features? Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet, so or something like that. you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller, so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic, simple and works fine, it's already a lot. if he has something that works fine and is really fancy, looks nice and it's easy easy to use, easy to use. But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller.	The User Interface Designer presented three different concepts to consider for the user interface and introduced the idea of using speech recognition in the design of the remote.
It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use, will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one. in which which which kind will be the the different bu button, it can be some, you know, classic pushbutton like this one, or you have also some button like L_C_D_ the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation, electric alimentation do you want to have, so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from, you know, the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal, so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation, you just, when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers but about the the price of adding this solar battery, would it be something really that will increase the price of production more, if we want to have battery, regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price, the plastic material is more common but, you know, something wooden will be like, I don't know high cl so a special high class, and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood. the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits, chips, or do you have low level or	The Industrial Designer presented possible materials to use in making the case for the remote, introduced the option of using a solar battery, and discussed options for buttons.
because for the intelligent controller, you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition, but as the um expert told us, most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels. Do you think they will be able to use gestures? Because, if they do all the time the same gesture, as you said previously in the last meeting, maybe they will get injuries because of that? or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five, I think they will be bored after a while. Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button. For example, if you cannot find your uh controller, you can just uh just just uh speak something such as, yeah, one two. but suppose you got a cold. You have a mute remote controller. but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition? For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very but suppose you have a family watching T_V_, and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time, do you think it will work? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time? so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time, that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller. Even you h you have the controller, I can I can say channel three, No, but this is disadvant disadvantage. And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to How how much will it cost? more expensive maybe. we don't have to do some basic research on this field. y y you have also the language problem, 'Cause it it have to be universal, The vocabulary is very small, but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international The recognition system will be able to understand French. this could be downloaded by	The team discussed the issue of using speech recognition at length.
we have to take decisions about the component concepts, about the energy. maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting, I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and, you know. No wood Something spongy. Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well. It's it's natural. so maybe we can stay with wood. But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons, Uh and what about the user interface concept? Google and fancy? Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this. the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_, so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually, So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller, maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood. And L_C_D_ buttons. I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add. commands, words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers. Even it is for s just some kids, you know, switching channels one two three four. Not very complex commands, but easy commands, Yeah, simple ones Okay.	The team discussed what materials to use and their interface concept.
trend watching. just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market, Um user really really want a fancy look and feel. Like the one you've shown, David, with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative, so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on. At the same time, it's important that it's easy to use. that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis. Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables, so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing. And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points, fancy look and feel has, on a score of seven would have six as importance. Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative, it's three. Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones. And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch, this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design. but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy? plastic-like, but rubber, mayb maybe, you know, rubber-like uh	The Marketing Specialist  discussed recent findings from trend watching reports.
Uh you will have to work more, Baba, on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control.	The User Interface Designer will work on adding a spongy quality to the buttons and the shape of the remote.
So you will have to work on the look and feel design, to have the easy to use, powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition.	The Industrial Designer will work on the look and feel of the design, the ease of use of the design, the characteristics of being powerful and fancy, and the speech recognition aspect.
I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller	The team will not use the intelligent controller proposed by the User Interface Designer.
So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control,	Two members of the team will work on creating a prototype made of clay
And L_C_D_ buttons.	The remote will have LCD buttons.
Yeah, simple ones Okay.	The remote will use speech recognition for simple commands.
but as the um expert told us, most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels. because for the intelligent controller, you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition, Do you think they will be able to use gestures? Because, if they do all the time the same gesture, as you said previously in the last meeting, maybe they will get injuries because of that? or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five, I think they will be bored after a while. Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button. For example, if you cannot find your uh controller, you can just uh just just uh speak something such as, yeah, one two. but suppose you got a cold. You have a mute remote controller. but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition? For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very but suppose you have a family watching T_V_, and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time, do you think it will work? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time? so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time, that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller. Even you h you have the controller, I can I can say channel three, No, but this is disadvant disadvantage. And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to How how much will it cost? more expensive maybe. we don't have to do some basic research on this field. y y you have also the language problem, 'Cause it it have to be universal, The vocabulary is very small, but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international The recognition system will be able to understand French. this could be downloaded by	Using speech recognition in the remote.
this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design. but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy? plastic-like, but rubber, mayb maybe, you know, rubber-like uh Something spongy. No wood I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and, you know. It's it's natural. so maybe we can stay with wood.	Whether to have a case that is made of wood or is spongy.
Google and fancy? So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller,	The team will mix the concepts of the Google controller and the fancy controller in their design.
maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting, maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood.	The remote will use solar energy.
Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well. maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood.	The remote will use low level chips.
so maybe we can stay with wood. maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood.	The case of the remote will be made of wood.
So it's v Um, you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel If you want to turn the ball, it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel. Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels? Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty? But this this has to stay on the table, right? In fact on a flat place You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn. You know tha that's the weak point,	Having a base on the remote which the user is required to turn in a circular motion in order to change the channel.
It's looks like some mushroom, so we call it mushroom design. Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape, you know, Yeah, because mushroom was not in the trends. Fruits and vegetables. Looks like more fruit. It looks more like a pineapple. let's say it's a pineapple now.	Whether to use a mushroom or another fruit or vegetable as the basis of the shape of the remote.
Uh yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still. It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere. Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side, the double R_.	The corporate logo will need to be incorporated into the product.
An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. I think there's a problem with the push push button. So we have one button,	The remote will feature only one push button.
An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. One s one scroll wheel, so	The remote will have a scroll wheel.
Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one?	The remote will have one solar cell.
Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah.	The case of the remote will be single curved.
There's no wood, so plastic just only, I think. I think you can transform the wood into plastic, maybe.	The remote will be made of plastic.
It looks more like a pineapple. let's say it's a pineapple now. But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.	The remote will be shaped like a pineapple.
but we have solar cells. I think you can transform the wood into plastic, maybe. We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black. An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah. One s one scroll wheel, so So we have one button, So, yeah. It think we we've done good job, as the cost is It's fine, twelve fifty uh	In discussing the production costs, the team settled on what features they wanted in the remote, while staying within the boundaries of their budget, and decided it was not necessary to completely redesign their product.
So did you enjoy your clay modelling? Yes. Of course. This is my job. Yeah, I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end. And designing, looking at the chips, the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for. Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings, maybe. 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards, so it um. So I think the costs are within the budget. do you think you can celebrate your creation? And you can celebrate your leadership. I'm not so happy about the fruit shape, you know. and we have a nearly final product.	The team then engaged in a project evaluation in which the team discussed the process of creating their product.
It need maybe some wo further work, but it's Yeah, especially on the easy to use But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.	The team decided that the prototype required further work.
we need to calculate the production cost. As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros. Um, how many do y do you need, solar cells? Uh I think in each ball you have three Single simple chip on print? And sample sensor, sample speaker. Mm. One maybe, yeah. So we are all already nineteen. The solar cell is too expensive. There's no wood, so plastic just only, I think. We have two special colours. We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip. Oh. Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells. Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one? I think you can transform the wood into plastic, maybe. We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black. An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah. I think there's a problem with the push push button. So we have one button, One s one scroll wheel, so Yeah, maybe two scroll wheel, as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel. Okay we I think we have problem. I think we s if we keep on adding things Push button. Mm. Yeah, we have four. I think it's more like double curved.	The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost.
Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape, you know, And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material, so. Yeah, the shape is unique, Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out, I dunno, maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or If you want to turn the ball, it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel. And where is the voice recognition? Ah, it's embedded, your microphone. First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel. No, the colour is okay, that's fine. but I would say there is more too much red. Right. So, from one to seven? Three. The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative. There four microphone. Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno, in the core, or single. We have tactile buttons. is it easy to use? Eh, for th the vocal command yes, it's might be easy. and you can turn like that to change the channel? then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one? It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the I think it's easier than traditional controller. you have you just turn the turn the ball. it's reasonable three. those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me. But this this has to stay on the table, right? In fact on a flat place You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn. You know tha that's the weak point, Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah. Yeah, four it's more reasonable, so. Uh yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still.	The team then conducted a product evaluation of the prototype.
And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative? Yeah, so you can capture s voice from different directions. Yeah. And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control, so it is I see, you have microphone array embedded. I think technically it's acceptable, so I would say two Yeah but this this turning Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels? and you can turn like that to change the channel? Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty? Oh yeah, that's difficult. That's dif that's difficult. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one? It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the I think b but the the vocal command is easy too. So it's coarse to fine design. that's very technologic, so. Yeah. yeah it's a sleeping remote control. Ah, that's not the ecological part, yeah. W that why we have the solar ti yeah. To compensate. I think it's easier than traditional controller. you have you just turn the turn the ball. But this this has to stay on the table, right? In fact on a flat place You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn. You know tha that's the weak point, Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah. Yeah, especially on the easy to use	Overall, the team found the prototype to be technologically innovative but had some issues with the prototype's appearance and its usability.
we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer, David Jordan, and our Industrial Designer, Baba. And the shape, there's two basic shape. The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece. So there are several key features of our pr prototype. The first is that it is fuzzy. I'm sure this would be the unique design the market. the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection. Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base. So it's v Um, you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel the low level chips inside It is in th in in the base, yeah. The battery it is under. In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototype for the remote.
Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red. It's looks like some mushroom, so we call it mushroom design. Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape, you know, Looks like more fruit. It looks more like a pineapple.	The prototype was yellow and red and was shaped like a mushroom.
so, it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make, but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket	The main concern is that they do not know what the product is, yet they have to make it fit that price bracket.
So um you have to work on the on the working design, you have to uh work on the technical functions, and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs,	The project manager designates each group member's task- working on the working design, technical functions, or user requirement specs.
So we need to close the meeting. So um you have to work on the on the working design, you have to uh work on the technical functions, and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs, Um you will receive some information by emails, i as usual.	The project manager closes the meeting, telling each group member what he is responsible for and reminding them that they will receive more information by email.
So, the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control.	The project goal is to develop a new remote control.
Um you will receive some information by emails, i as usual.	They will receive more information by email.
And we should target the inter an international market.	They will target the international market.
So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control	The target selling price will be 25 Euro dollars.
which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros, okay.	They need to generate a profit of fifty million Euros.
is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling?	A group member asks whether it is going to be a stand-alone unit, or one that requires a T.V. beforehand.
So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control	The remote control's target selling price of twenty-five Euro dollars and will be for the international market.
which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros, okay.	They will generate a proft of fifty million Euros.
so another important part of the project is about money,	After that they briefly discuss finances.
so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings. Okay so, want me to draw my favourite animal. Well, I don't really have a favourite animal, but um I'm gonna about the uh spider I dunno why, but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther So, not the favourite animal, but I think I'll draw elephant.	Then they take turns drawing their favorite animal on the white board.
So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go. should it be um specific remote control to some specific device? Should it be a universal one?	They did not decide yet what type of remote control to produce- whether it should be for a specific device or universal.
As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company. It is in three step as you know. First the functional design. The second's a conceptual design, and then the detailed design. During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately, individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next.	He also mentions the three-step project- functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design.
Um it should be original, trendy, and also user friendly.	It should be original, trendy, and user-friendly.
So, the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control.	The project manager states the goal of the project, which is to develop a new remote control.
I'm uh Michael. I'm the user interface designer. Hi I'm Guillermo. I'm the Marketing Expert. And I am Hemant, the industrial designer.	The rest introduce themselves, including Michael the interface designer, Guillermo the marketing expert, and Hemant the industrial designer.
So, we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes. Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager.	The project manager Sebastian opens the meeting.
And finally, the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting, but I don't know if the budget would be large enough. But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology. I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the it could be command control kind of thing. It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated.	He suggests the use of using voice recognition or an LCD, which they discuss despite concerns about budget limitation.
So maybe we could start with the market, yeah. and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls. And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly, thoroughly. So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control, the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control. So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes, for right and left handed people. Well th the on the thing is though, most remote controls are used by more than one person. Well maybe it could be a universal design.	The marketing expert presents some research done on user opinions of remotes.
But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project. So, I just put d quickly Remo, Any ideas? Uh the Powerstick. Maybe a Spanish name would work well. Mando. What does it mean in Spanish? Control. So, let's go for Mando?	He suggests they name the project and they come up with "mando", meaning "control" in Spanish.
Okay, let's have a look to the agenda today. So, we are going to have a meeting about the functional design. Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting. So uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control, but I have new um new i inputs for about that topics. I goin I'm going to share with you. so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations.	The project manager opens the meeting stating that they will address the functional design of the remote and saying they are still undecided about whether it should be universal or specific.
user i interface could be of two types, one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology. and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote. And for voice, limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote. That increases the the cost also.	He suggests they have two types of user interfaces and brings up that voice recognition would increase production price.
So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price, it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ So you could have the name of the programme, you could have um the start time you know where it's up to. so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control, if you want to browse, in addition to the T_V_, or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe, or a you know.	Although the project manager clearly does not favor the idea because of budget costs and the possible requirement of internet connection, others are pushing for it.
user i interface could be of two types, one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology. and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote. but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel. Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough? Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets, though, my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control. I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it. Actually I'm not so sure you know if I was using a remote control to, say, turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well, I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control.	They discuss voice recognition again, and then the interface specialist presents.
but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen So this is something else we might wanna consider, is really kind of limiting the number of buttons, but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important, but also the number of buttons. Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time, but contains the extra buttons like, say, the number buttons for instance. Um if I had my perfect remote control, I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way. because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional Um okay, so, I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number.	He says Internet capability might be necessary for an LCD and then brings up button size, suggesting having a flip-open door with extra buttons under it.
Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote, and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com, which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site. and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant, well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control, and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide, but it has a scroll wheel on it, I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel. because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro, this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple, the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen, just for changing channel numbers easily. and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks. Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights, I dunno, close the windows, whatever, turn the heating on,	The industrial designer presents, showing examples of existing products and suggesting they add a scroll wheel for channel-changing.
and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to T_V_.	The remote control will be for television only.
and you have to go through a trend watching.	The marketing expert will work on trend-watching.
Uh you have to work on user interface,	The interface specialist will work on the user interface.
we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy, which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small, not too big. We should bring new technologies for young peoples, So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price, it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies. well, could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control? For twenty five Euro? I think it's impossible. because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control, So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh of increasing the unit price. what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control? So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_? So you could have the name of the programme, you could have um the start time you know where it's up to. I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_. we don't go for speech recognition technology. The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion. But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars, Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control? I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies. Um so you have to work on the component uh concept. Uh you have to work on user interface, and you have to go through a trend watching.	They talk about the budget limitations on features and then the project manager summarizes decisios made and closes the meeting by teeling each group member what he should work on.
So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh of increasing the unit price. But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars, Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control?	They find that the budget is restricting their capabilities, and mentioned increasing the price of the remote control.
Um so you have to work on the component uh concept.	The industrial designer will work on the component concept.
and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies. we don't go for speech recognition technology.	Because of budget restrictions, they cannot do speech recognition technologies.
We should bring new technologies for young peoples,	To target towards young people will bring in new technology.
we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy, which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small, not too big.	The remote control should be fancy, a good shape, and not too small or too big.
well, could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control? The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion. So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing.	They have not yet decided whether to include an LCD screen.
and uh finally, it should be clear that the corporate image, that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product.	Corporate logo will be clearly displayed on product.
So you're having the basis station and there is a button, if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is. Uh I think that's a pretty handy feature. Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget. basis station is nothing more, just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits.	They agree on having base station with the remote.
Then uh there are different kind of chips, one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip. Pricing is a factor for us, that's why we'll go for the regular chip.	The industrial desiger tells them they will use a regular chip rather than the advanced one since pricing is a factor.
So we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do. We'll have a base station extra uh on the side. So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis. Uh, we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping. and your tur turbo turbo uh button. Yeah, which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device, And and you have two wheels. Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well.	After that the project manager has them discuss/reiterate the decisions made during the meeting:  no LCD screen, the remote will have a base station, a RF for beeping, a button on the base station to press, possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control, 2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level, a turbo button perhaps underneath the device, on/off button for the TV.
I'm just wondering actually, 'cause, you know, I this whole fruit thing with the banana, it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche, like only a few people would really want a banana, but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana? You know, rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana, you could make it kind of silver. If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana. maybe like still in the shape of a banana. Um, but you know, just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana	They go on to have discussion, with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example, it could be silver.
but are we set on the banana idea? the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy. Yes it is. Yeah, okay, so capsicum or pepper. Yeah. I don't know, it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me, like But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top	They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape, and one group member feels that the shape is not handy.
and then it should be double curve. The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve. with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve.	In addition, he talks about giving the control a double curve, curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle.
Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation.	The marketing expert has to look up product evaluation.
You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface, in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype.	Before the next meeting, the interface specialist and industrial designer have to work together on the user interface and the look/feel design.
We'll have a base station extra uh on the side. So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis. and your tur turbo turbo uh button. Yeah, which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device, And and you have two wheels. Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well.	The remote will have a base station, a button on the base station to press, 2 scroll wheels for the channels and volume, a turbo button (possibly underneath the device), and an on/off button for the TV.
So this is out of discussion. I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine, so So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing. No we can we can't use that. Well, I f I think it's probably more than, than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine, you know, to say hello in the morning. L_C_D_ has already been ruled out, A_S_R_ has been ruled out.	Thus far, LCD and ASR have been ruled out.
I investigate deeper the preference of the users. What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device. After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking, what they what they find more more interesting, more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel. So now more more cool aspect, ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things, a device which is pleasant to to watch, to see. all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables. And also in the in the U_S_A_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy. What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy? I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit, there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes.	The marketing expert is first to present, and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device, particularly one that favors current trends.
So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana, Vegetable textures and all this kind. So which fruit are you thinking of? I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit, but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable, instead of vegetable, some natur mm uh natural object or something. or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the No, not n not not too much focus, not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different. I'm not, I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though, like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner, Is fruit cool? Okay, but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know, Well, probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of, a cucumber. Maybe too long. and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also. and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros?	They then begin talking about using a fruit, vegetable, or natural object as the shape of the remote, the logo, or for the buttons.
you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons.	Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana.
So you are User Interface guy.	Next, the user interface specialist presents.
Okay. So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit, It means that it can recognize, it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that. Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords? it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords, but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase. So this is not s really to do to to do control. It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing, yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view.	He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit, which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control.
I guess you could build that in, you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control. but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done.	They have the option of using that technology.
I've also included this turbo button because I think, you know, every design should have a turbo button, so with this turbo button you can, say, skip over t channels if uh, you know, if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them	He also included a turbo button for speed, which he thinks every design should have.
But um, I've just indicated here, we could have actually two scroll wheels, But I think it's important, you know, to have two scroll wheels because, you know, you want one for for the channel, but you also want one for for the volume,	He suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume.
It might be useful to have some kind of base station, even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping, you know, this is a way of finding the remote.	After that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost.
So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing.	Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea.
but are we set on the banana idea?	The group has not yet agreed on whether the remote should be banana-shaped.
So today is um our third meeting. It will be about the conceptual design uh.	The project manager opens the meeting, stating that it is about conceptual design.
um. We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs. Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point.	He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen.
I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need, um. it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana well, I guess you need an on and off switch, but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe, you know,	He shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have.
So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform	Then they move on to the three presentations.
Well, I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote But you know our targets are very high, means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make.	There is concern that the shape is not handy and might make the product less marketable- that would be a problem since they have to meet the fifty million euros profit goal.
but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one, it'll bring the cost down Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood.	Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum.
So this is going to be about the component design. So first thing is we need power source for the remote control.	Lastly, the industrial designer presents, discussing the power source of the remote control.
Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces, I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy.	He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell, which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design.
So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies, one is the usual batteries which are there, they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells, when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind.	He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good.
So final design. Final design. well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over We've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button What's the use uh of the t turbo button already? This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops. If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button, so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_. once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext, they are no more for channel or vol volume. And this is the uh the infrared uh port. in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana. And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas? And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries. And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana. It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana. I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station. Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station? No eight or eight or ten hours of working. If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer. Pricing is was a factor	They have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design, features, and power source, type of chip and weight of the remote.
Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two, No L_C_D_, no speech recognition technology, okay, we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control. And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost.	The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting.
And this is the uh the infrared uh port. in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana.	Infared port on top of banana as well as bottom front of base station.
which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel	The volume scroll wheel will be on the left, channel scroll on the right.
Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip. Well we decided against the solar cells so I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing. So we have the regular chip on the print, which is one. I put single curved. To reduce the cost, it's okay. Okay it's gonna have to be plastic. So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that. but you know the turbo button does add that extra class. Make it plastic instead of rubber.	For pricing reasons they had to use a regular chip instead of advanced, single curve instead of double, rechargable batteries instead of solar cells, and eliminate the turbo button.
This is a teletext button. once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext, they are no more for channel or vol volume.	Will contain a teletext button, when pressed teletext appears and channel selector can be used to navigate through the teletext.
I put single curved. To reduce the cost, it's okay.	For pricing reasons the remote will have a single, not double curve.
well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh	It will be shaped like a banana, with an base station resembling a banana leaf for it to sit on.
Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip. So we have the regular chip on the print, which is one.	For pricing reasons they will use a regular chip for the control rather than advanced one.
I put single curved. To reduce the cost, it's okay. So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that.	They eliminate the turbo button and give the remote a single curve because of budget restrictions.
So we have the regular chip on the print, which is one. So we stick to plastic, it cost nothing. Too expensive. Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber Okay so special colour, yellow. We have three. We have two scroll, and we have three push buttons. Okay it's gonna have to be plastic. Make it plastic instead of rubber.	They keep the regular chip, stick with plastic, put two scroll wheels and three push buttons, and make it a special shade of yellow.
So we can go to through to project evaluation. No we have a product which none of us would buy. Okay so um project process. Well in fact I I did not know I didn't know really what to say here. Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen, not that much. I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity. And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting. Yeah maybe we should go through, yeah an uh evaluation. Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless. So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market. I think that's actually something that should be in version two, is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_ I think we we can go Okay so thanks very much.	They briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting.
Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or Yeah, it's fancy, according to me. Seven. Seven by me. Yeah uh five. but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote, 'cause of the scroll wheels Functional. I'll give five. Well it depends when you say functional, do you mean it does what we want it to do, or d does what it does, you know, can it make you coffee? Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro Well it's not a universal remote. Four. Okay cool? Cool device. There I'll give it seven. For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature. I would say five. I say I said seven. Of course I'll buy the banana. I'll say five. I find it quite cheap actually. I dunno. If i i it depends, if you live in in Switzerland or you live in Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or I don't want a banana on my living room table, a banana remote. Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this. don't forget who we're targeting also No, it's I. I would buy I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control, really. So you say two. I say five. If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro, if that was like my limit, maybe I would buy it. I stick to five. will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana. No uh let's say I'll put two. If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to I'd say a three. So it's somewhere three point five I think. So	They rate each criteria on a scale of 0 (true) to 7 (false): how fancy it is, how handy it is, how functional, how cool it is, whether they would spend twenty five euro for it, and whether they would change their current remote for this one.
We have three.	Three push buttons.
No eight or eight or ten hours of working. If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer. I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station. Well we decided against the solar cells so I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing.	For pricing reasons eliminate solar cells - use rechargable batteries as power source, base station used for battery-charging which should last 8-10 hours depending on frequency of use.
So we have to go through now evaluations. I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements. so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven. Why this strange factor of seven? Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale, I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard?	They go through the evaulations, using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert.
It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana. And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana.	Weight of an actual banana but a special shade of yellow.
Well we decided against the solar cells so I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing.	In doing this, they decide against solar cells and go with the rechargable batteries.
Um well we are going to calculate the production costs. We should we should be below twelve point five. No kinetic also. Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing. So we we'll put some extras, if there is something. we're just using the the very beep simple beep, Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that, And we have sample speaker. Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic. So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go so we have margin for that stuff.	Next they do a cost estimate for production.
And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world.	The remote will be sold internationally.
We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro.	The production costs cannot exceed 12.50 Euro.
Um, so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control, and any idea? Well, from experience, um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small, and it's been very hard to to to use, because there's so many buttons, you know, on a T_V_ remote you only ever use, mostly, you know, f four or f six buttons. Um. Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light, so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light. And the second thing, f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control. But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like. Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards, I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves, because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune.	The team then discussed their experiences with remotes, focusing on various features they would like to see in the remote they will produce, as well as features they find unappealing in current remotes.
Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control,	The interface designer will work on the technical functions of the remote.
you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control.	The marketing expert will find the user requirements for the remote
Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro.	The remote will sell for 25 Euro.
Uh, we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control. So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project. I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself. so my name is Petre. Uh, in the project I'm supposed to be the technic. 'Kay. So my name's Bob Morris. I'm the Marketing Expert for this project. My name is Hamed Getabdar, and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project.	The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves by name and their role in the project.
We are talking about the project plan, Um. So what is the goal of this project? Is to design a new remote control. So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way. Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project. For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it. So I will ask you all to do the same. Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal? Yeah, yeah, you can draw the picture, of course.	The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then had the team members participate in a tool training exercise in which each member drew his favorite animal on the white board and discussed what he liked about the animal.
Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro. And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world. We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro.	The project manager also discussed selling prices and the project budget.
so so we keep all these all these buttons. So we've got channel and volume. Um. A button is better.	The remote will have buttons for channel changing, volume settings, numerals, and power on/off.
If we if we add the time, we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that,	Whether to have a display function.
so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff,	The remote will feature an LCD screen.
We should hide them somewhere.	Lesser used functions will be able to be accessed on the remote but they will be hidden on the remote.
Probably not. W In my opinion we should have only useful thing	The remote will not have a time button.
What about things like the clock and um timers? If we if we add the time, we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that, I mean, are users wants to have the time on the on the remote? Probably not. W In my opinion we should have only useful thing	Whether to have a timer feature.
Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home, and actually it's not useful to have teletext.	The team will not work with teletext.
Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_, not for D_V_D_ and other devices,	The remote will only be used for televisions.
So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control. Um Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home, and actually it's not useful to have teletext. Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_, not for D_V_D_ and other devices, the third one is uh about the the the image of the company. It's That mean we should use the colour of our company So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable. and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company, which is uh, we put fashion of in electronics. So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control. Well, should we start with just the core, the basic functions that we need. And then we can move on to the more advanced features. I think we should stick on very useful functions, because we want less button. So, turning channel, of course. Volume setting. Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number. will we use only two buttons, or or like numbered buttons? Maybe we could have key buttons, like uh discovery channe like documentary channel, and movies channel and so so we keep all these all these buttons. If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus. So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably, to to tell you We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume, with the channel. I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere, We should hide them somewhere. I mean a power button's obviously uh required. Uh, well I think when they say power button they mean	The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and initiated a discussion in which the team discussed and decided on various features to include in the remote they will produce.
So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable. It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company, which is uh, we put fashion of in electronics. the third one is uh about the the the image of the company.	The corporate image must be recognizable in the product.
I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere,	Whether to include lesser used functions in the remote.
This I was thinking. Do we need a power button at all? Uh, well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off. Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it? Should we make it a button, or some some something which would be A button is better.	Whether to have a power button.
Okay, so here is my presentation about technical function design. Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands. And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air Okay, uh about what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh, usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control. They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves. uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way. And uh uh again, using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred, as I see. Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home? Uh, I don't think so, And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control, for example? but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave, so the only your T_V_ can understand it	The interface specialist discussed the interior workings of a remote and stated a preference for using radio waves over infra-red technology.
And speech recognition in remote unit, it will be very e expensive. But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer, you know. If we decide to use the speech recognition, then we probably could struggle	Cost of adding speech recognition to a remote.
Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home? Uh, I don't think so, And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control, for example?	Whether using radio waves will interfere with other technology a user owns.
I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company. so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on, And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards, after after our discussion, if we have some contacts in some companies, so, which can report on what is going on there, So, I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves but you know, when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ well, L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_, But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer, you know. And uh my personal preference is yes, I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit, but from the point of view uh of the design and price, I would stick to I_R_s.	The industrial designer discussed particular components that a remote could include.
Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes. Uh so we will see our three presentations. Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements, whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device. Okay, so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control. So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market. seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on, found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly. Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user, Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls. And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons, the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control. And basically they came they said the channel, volume, and power buttons had the highest relevance to users, And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it.	The project manager opened the meeting and then the marketing expert discussed user requirements.
And the price is fairly cheap for this.	Cost of infra-red components.
In particular, do they want an L_C_D_ d display, and secondly, do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control. Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes. So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market.	The marketing expert also found that younger users want an LCD display and a remote capable of speech recognition.
will we use only two buttons, or or like numbered buttons? Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number.	How to minimize the number of buttons on the remote while having buttons to access channels.
uh I think you should work together, s you uh Hamed and Peter, to work uh in a in a first prototype,	The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype
And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation.	The marketing expert will work on the project evaluation.
The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device.	The user interface designer will work on the user interface design.
So, the more frequent buttons should be larger, they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control. so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels, Uh. And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier.	The user interface designer discussed the placement of commonly used buttons, the overall shape of a remote, and how to hide less commonly used buttons.
Okay. So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use. Um generally, generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something, in my opinion, uh the first feature is just to be easy to use. And uh s uh I can conclude like this, that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it. they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control. So, the more frequent buttons should be larger, Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand. And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery, it should not uh consume lots of energy. so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels, Uh. And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier. And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good. but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy.	The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for a remote that is easy to use.
And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy. From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan, um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes, shoes and furniture. Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well, Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative. so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel, um as opposed to a functional look and feel, is our number one priority. I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature.	He found that current trends are such that a product must have a fancy look and feel, be technologically innovative, be easy to use, incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif, and must be spongy.
Okay. Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world. Um so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel, um as opposed to a functional look and feel, is our number one priority. Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well, Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative. From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan, um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes, shoes and furniture. And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy.	The marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports.
Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be,	The project manager stated that the goal for the current meeting was to decide upon a concept for the remote the team is creating.
should should discover the other buttons, which are hidden. Yeah, peeling of the banana. Is it is it possible to do that? If you see it's like peeling. You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces, some some interfaces for adaptor.	How to hide the lesser used buttons.
I dunno if it can fit with the technology. The screen has to be square? But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches, so. It's like more more expensive to have shape like that. I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen.	How to have a fruit shaped remote with an LCD screen.
My first idea is because our colour is more yellow, and the it should be easy to take in a hand, I thought about banana, or something like that, which is fruits, and Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice, with the colour of our company. I dunno if it can fit with the technology. Is it is it possible to do that? If you see it's like peeling. You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces, some some interfaces for adaptor.	How to incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif into the design of the remote.
Um, so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design.	The industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design.
Uh first I think energy it's a key problem so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions. If we use the batteries, and the additional so solar cell, then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_, so no problem in energy, I think. I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large. Could you re could you redesign your board? I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_, if it's possible. Okay, so five to ten, I I think it's it's feasible. So using some L_C_D_s we can touch, so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh, I dunno the name, L_C_D_ responding to fingers. So let's go for a small L_C_D_. My first idea is because our colour is more yellow, and the it should be easy to take in a hand, I thought about banana, or something like that, which is fruits, and Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice, with the colour of our company. I dunno if it can fit with the technology. The screen has to be square? But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches, so. So we are agree with the banana thing? It's like more more expensive to have shape like that. I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen. So, the last point we decided it's infra-red, I guess. should should discover the other buttons, which are hidden. Yeah, peeling of the banana. Is it is it possible to do that? I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that, If you see it's like peeling. You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces, some some interfaces for adaptor. it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic	The team then discussed and made decisions regarding the option to use solar cells, the specifications of an LCD screen, how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif into their design, and how to hide lesser used buttons.
that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen, which is good news for us, since we wanted to include a display there. And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there, we must use additional source of energy, which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything. Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing, or is there any problem for that? A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape, basically. Well, sponginess. Maybe it a good feature, since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good, because it's just keeps it safe,	The industrial designer focused on the use of a TFT screen and the use of solar cells to supplement the energy from two regular batteries.
that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen, which is good news for us, since we wanted to include a display there. So there will be some circuit uh for the power. Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there, we must use additional source of energy, which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything. Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres, And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone, which is somewhere,	The industrial designer discussed various components and energy sources the remote could include.
Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something. Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still Yeah, but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that, you know. I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something. I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large. Could you re could you redesign your board? Okay, so five to ten, I I think it's it's feasible.	The size and shape of the remote.
So if we use s solar cells, um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside?	Whether users will expose the remote to sunlight to recharge it if the remote contains solar cells.
Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen? how big is it in reality? Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal. But I I think we can we can cut it. So so for the same price we have four screens now.	Size of TFT screen and its impact on the size of the remote overall.
So we add also the speech recognition device.	The remote will use speech recognition.
should should discover the other buttons, which are hidden. I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that,	The remote will have a hidden layer containing the lesser used buttons.
If we use the batteries, and the additional so solar cell, then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_, I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that,	The remote will have a spongy outer layer.
So, the last point we decided it's infra-red, I guess.	The remote will use infra-red technology.
So we are agree with the banana thing?	The remote will resemble a banana.
So using some L_C_D_s we can touch, so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh, I dunno the name, L_C_D_ responding to fingers.	The LCD screen on the remote will be a touch screen.
I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_, if it's possible. So let's go for a small L_C_D_.	The remote will feature a small sized LCD screen.
So. Twenty five Euro for a remote control.	The remote will be sold for 25 Euro.
Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum.	The production costs for the remote will be 12.50 Euro maximum.
Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working. and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations.	The remote will be adaptable so that it can be used by right-handed and left-handed people.
Go back button is good.	The remote will feature a button which allows the user to return to the previous channel he was viewing.
Remote controls children proof.	The remote will be child proof.
No, that's a good idea. colourful, maybe Yeah even we can change colours, no? like the phones and these things we c yeah.	The remote will be colorful and will have different colored changeable face plates.
Um, so let's try the whiteboard. Um so any of you who want to go. It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw.	The team members then participated in an exercise in which each team member drew his favorite animal and discussed why he liked the particular animal.
and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations. may need more than three mm three button, three mm possibilities, ye yeah. But for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, and nothing else. but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five. But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit.	How many buttons and actions to include on the remote.
We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control. and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan, Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design, it's conceptual design, and desail detailed design. and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day.	The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the upcoming project to the team members.
And it should be really small and. Small also? at least it should hold in your hand n properly, like.	Size of remote.
no screens, it's too complex. Mm. So, some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what Too expensive for twelve Euro?	Whether to include a screen similar to one found on a cell phone on the remote.
And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do.	The team members will work on the technical aspects of the remote
and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones, make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want.	The team members will work on the ideas which arose during the meeting and decide which ones are useful and which ones should be discarded.
Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones, make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want. And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do. So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes. So what does M_E_ means? Market Expert. Uh that's me. the user requirement specifications,	The project manager closed the meeting and gave the team members their assignments and then one of the team members briefly went over his role on the team.
So that could be a great um application. Remote controls children proof. but mainly it has to be very robust colourful, maybe No, that's a good idea. Yeah even we can change colours, no? like the phones and these things we c yeah. And it should be really small and. Small also? Should it be, y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control at least it should hold in your hand n properly, like. Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place. no screens, it's too complex. Mm. So, some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what Too expensive for twelve Euro? Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working. and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations. may need more than three mm three button, three mm possibilities, ye yeah. But for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, and nothing else. but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five. But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit. And then back to the one I was before, yeah, that would be cool. Go back button is good.	The team members discussed child proof capabilities, color options, how to adapt a remote for left-handed users, a "go back" function, the size of a remote, buttons, and LCD screens.
So any of you have experience in remote controls? So that could be a great um application. Remote controls children proof. but mainly it has to be very robust colourful, maybe No, that's a good idea. Yeah even we can change colours, no? like the phones and these things we c yeah. And it should be really small and. Small also? Should it be, y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control at least it should hold in your hand n properly, like. Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place. no screens, it's too complex. Mm. So, some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what Too expensive for twelve Euro? Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working. and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations. may need more than three mm three button, three mm possibilities, ye yeah. But for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, and nothing else. but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five. But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit. And then back to the one I was before, yeah, that would be cool. Go back button is good.	The team then discussed their experiences using remotes in the past and what features to consider implementing in the remote they will produce.
Yeah, we're to sell two million then. On the international market.	The project manager also indicated that the remote will be sold internationally and that two million remotes are expected to be sold.
Let's talk about money. So. Twenty five Euro for a remote control. On the international market. Yeah, we're to sell two million then. Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum.	After the drawing exercise, the project manager discussed selling prices and production costs for the remote the team will design.
Like, you want to find it, you shout and it answers is I'm here? Or But that's ex that's expensive. Uh. Just beeps? I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them because of the the frequency they they just answer to that. You can clap. Can you?	How to locate a remote when misplaced.
we can have another, like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip. you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things, yeah. because we have only very few words like like power, switch on or some like The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume, up, down. so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording	How speech recognition commands work.
Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them, So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control. We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings.	Allowing users in the same household to have their own remotes with personal settings.
I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting. I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation. Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement we need uh to know the the user uh needs we want to know how it going to work third part uh I don't remember let's go for the three presentations,	The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda to the team members.
but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control. I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah.	Making the remote universal.
You know these days we have hundreds of channels, for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five, how would I do can I do that with this? Basically you use just four or five channels, One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap. So even if they are only watching four or five channels, I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels,	Users habits in jumping from channel to channel.
So we've listed a couple of uh Functions. that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session, but it is very relevant. People want to have a power button. Channel selection is uh o often used very often used Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings. Audio settings, screen settings, even teletext and channel settings. All of them. they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant. It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant, but seems that it's average relevant at least, so. I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext, that it's out of date now because of internet. if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control, so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want. So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age. Young people, probably because it's a buzz word, find it very relevant. And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down. So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control? I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider. If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so that's basically my findings	The marketing expert also stated that young users like speech recognition and that users in general want buttons for power, channel selection, volume control, and a few lesser used settings.
Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah. And we have um maybe we have to we say, only for T_V_, not teletext?	The team will concentrate on making a remote only for televisions and then make their product more generalized later.
so first um Marketing Expert. So as you know, you I think you already know me, Sammy Benjo. I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls, what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control, let's ask people who are users of remote controls what they like, what they don't like So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls. First of all, they find it very ugly. uh they're not nice colour, not nice shape, I mean they're all the same, Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control, so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um. and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls. And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used, so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using. people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance uh they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please, where are you? Like uh something to to like t I think phones	The marketing expert discussed the findings of a survey which indicated that current remotes are ugly, difficult to use, have a number of unused buttons, frustrate users when misplaced, and contribute to RSI.
even automatic on off is also a bit problematic, Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible.	An automatic on/off feature will not be used.
I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext, that it's out of date now because of internet. And we have um maybe we have to we say, only for T_V_, not teletext?	The team will not work with teletext.
and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching.	The marketing expert will work on trend watching
uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept	The user interface designer will focus on the user interface concept.
Uh as you know, I am mister Ramaro. I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control. as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device, like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera. So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions, what we want on this portable device. so to do these functions we need an interface, which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that. And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device. uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want, we ought to have some kind of processor And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations, and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s, To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh. because the people don't use one particular brand so So we need to check their specifications So we need to have particular encryption codes. so I'll input the connections to all this components. so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them. Mm-hmm. And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard, or mm. and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy, we can have another, like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip. and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser you can find even simple mobile device like	The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and how to handle universal capability and speech recognition.
my name is Mark Dwight, and um I am responsible for User Interface Design. However, uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design. that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this. And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task We should never complicate things too much. We should only make a remote control, nothing more. Nothing more than this, just a remote control. 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use. So here is this remote control. It's quite a standard one, but it's not from a T_V_, it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something. But you know, we can use it for a T_V_ easily. Only buttons we need is on off, volume, channels and maybe some options or something else, I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button. Maybe it can be yeah middle of like, between those two compared to this one Our question of the style, we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium. It is unbreakable and it is very universal. W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours, and we can put all the options into this screen. We'll need only few buttons. All the other things can be controlled through the screen. And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click, I would propose this concept for design, just few buttons, a screen with a back light which can change colours, titanium We need power and volume. And let us include two nice features into this device, first, power on and off can be made fully automatic. When you go to the sofa, take your control and point it to the T_V_, the T_V_ turns	The user interface designer presented existing remotes to exemplify the need for simpler designs, discussed the use of components such as titanium and a back-lit LCD screen, and discussed other features to consider such as color options.
you will focus on the component concept um	The industrial designer will focus on the components concept.
we're now going to l have the lunch break. Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work, and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting, and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components you will focus on the component concept um uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching. of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach. And we have um maybe we have to we say, only for T_V_, not teletext? Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible. But speech recogniser can be possible. Uh, should it be equipped with the uh, with uh speakers? Like, you want to find it, you shout and it answers is I'm here? Or But that's ex that's expensive. Uh. Just beeps? I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them because of the the frequency they they just answer to that. You can clap. Can you? But it's a good feature I guess yeah	After the project manager's closing, the project manager recapped some decisions and the team discussed how to handle the issue of locating a remote when misplaced.
and we just stick with two batteries	The remote will use two regular batteries.
Mm I think it's what we say, that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information.	The remote will feature an LCD screen.
But it would be expensive, no? If you use colour L_C_D_. if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly. Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler. you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_, I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that. It might be optional, yeah.	How to account for the increase in production costs for a remote that comes in different colors.
Do you think it can come in several colours? I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours. Um but not the case. Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff, Because apparently from your survey people like colours, let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels. so that would be the option But it would be expensive, no? If you use colour L_C_D_. Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler. if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly. you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_, there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact, um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are, like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around, like what colour is around, and depending on the temperature, but that's maybe mo too much expensive, yeah.	Whether to allow the LCD or the remote case to come in different colors.
But full assembly We'll use mainly for titanium And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes. So maybe titanium it's not a good idea. because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess. I think uh the rubber aspect might be important If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good. Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium. you explore now that you're going to work together these these two.	Whether to make a remote out of rubber or titanium.
but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much? Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it? I just want to say it should be real smart. since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use So it could be smart in that way. it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that The remote that knows you.	How to make a "smart" remote.
Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber, if it is something that it seems to be light. W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts we want to follow general trend. No, we don't have to, Again, as I said we can also try to make it, to create the trend. are we confident enough on creating trends?	Whether the team should invent their own trend.
Do you think it can come in several colours? I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours. Um but not the case. Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff, Because apparently from your survey people like colours, let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels. so that would be the option But it would be expensive, no? If you use colour L_C_D_. Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler. if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly. you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_, there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact, um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are, like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around, like what colour is around, and depending on the temperature, but that's maybe mo too much expensive, yeah. Because uh I think there are two kinds of people. Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that. It might be optional, yeah. Could we integrate something into our remote control, something like light? That they can use it in darkness, like. Hand light, And um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much? I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it? I just want to say it should be real smart. since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use So it could be smart	The user interface designer also discussed with the team color options and how to make a "smart" remote which is in tune with the user's preferences.
we want the speech recogniser	The remote will contain a speech recognizer.
the concept of the interface. Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface, but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls. We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button, I don't know really where it is, maybe one of this buttons, maybe this button is power on and off? that's our concept. It's called the millennium remote control. doesn't make sense. This is very ugly. too much concept. we will not use this. We will not use this. But instead of this I will devise That's our concept. And it's got just few buttons, quite low looking, and all this stuff we already we already discussed.	The user interface designer presented his concept for the interface design which he called the "millennium remote control".
we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy, and the material and interface. For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities. First one, we can use simple battery, or we can use traditional solar cells mm and the material we can have plastic, rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then uh titanium, which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display. we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control. this can be simple kind of programmable chip which can use microphone sensors. Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range, like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that. So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house. we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes. What is a double-curved shape? Like you can have two curves. we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive, since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost. Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber, if it is something that it seems to be light. Uh Uh And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium	The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries, case materials and shapes, chips, and interface components and also discussed the components necessary for a speech recognition capable remote control.
and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables,	The remote will incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme.
now we are on the conceptual design meeting. I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design, first Rama then Mark and then Sammy. Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes. the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept, so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case. And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements. And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing.	The project manager stated the agenda and set the goals for the current meeting.
and we want some kind of buttons	The remote will have some buttons.
and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation.	The marketing expert will work on the product evaluation.
which i which are for Rama uh wil design, um Mark the user interface design,	The user interface designer will work on the interface design.
we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again. Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design, and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation. um Mark the user interface design, Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay. um and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction. we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables, we want to follow general trend. No, we don't have to, Again, as I said we can also try to make it, to create the trend. are we confident enough on creating trends? we can make it smell like fruit. what about location and these things, people are really interesting on those features? Or they really like They more want these fancy features it has to be fancy Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important. so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness. Do we take titanium smelling like fruit, or do we make spongy uh fruity-like we will try to explore these two options Maybe you could explore the two option. Could we make a titanium shape? I mean fruit-shaped. at least like we can make banana Doub double-curved. Don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body. you explore now that you're going to work together these these two. Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium. I think we have to choose. If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy still we want to keep	The project manager gave the team members their assignments and then the team went over the decisions they had made and discussed whether to use titanium or rubber in their design.
I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control. Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know, but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to. The first one, which seems to be the most important one, is that it has to be fancy, it has to have a fancy look and feel. And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing. It has to be fancy. Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be, it has to be technologically i innovative, it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control. And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control. currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan, well, it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel And I think of course uh i it applies to everything. It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea. And uh if we co we compare to last year, now it has to be spongy, When we were talking about rubber, I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess. So maybe titanium it's not a good idea. Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy, even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more	The marketing expert discussed current findings from trend watching reports which indicated that there is a desire for products to have a fancy look and feel, be technologically innovative, be easy to use, incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, and be spongy.
Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay.	The user interface designer and industrial designer will work together on a prototype
Okay. So first, let's uh see the prototype.	This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype.
So, but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay,	After the team realised the prototype was over budget, they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo.
So we are at seventeen dot eight.	The prototype was more than 40% over budget.
Project evaluation, good. Mm. See mm how Are we a good team? Mm. Is there enough room for creativity? Yeah, yeah. Team-work, very strong, I would say.	Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership.
let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium. so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven. One meaning that, ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion, whatever it is. what do you think, is it fancy? So here, two. Up. Then we have uh technology. d I think it's a one for that, at least. Robustness, uh-huh. It's um robust, yeah. Well, so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control? Okay, two. So size and weight. Up to three for that, Colour and shape. I suggested three. And uh the last one is adaptive. Okay. Let's go for one. Now we have to do the average. Two point one seven. So now, it has to fulfil the financial criterium? So we are at seventeen dot eight.	The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive.
So think of what we can cut uh here. Are we supposed to cut things out now?	The team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype.
Material, we want to stick to titanium. wh what are the strawberries for? The case is silver titanium, no? So, maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges, stuff for strawberries and different colours. Titanium.	The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion.
wh what are the strawberries for? That's location sensors. And what about the strawberries on the top?	The gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case (even if they cover sensors) did not meet everyone's approval.
I'm not convince. Well y you know, it's this uh fruit and vegetable year.	Although, the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends, the result did not satisfy the program manager.
And we have speech recognition. And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser. And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition.	It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device.
And so, we have buttons and using L_C_D_, or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_, and then do on and off. So, you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume. And you can choose colours on your day for each day, or even many colours. For the L_C_D_. It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen. The scroll-wheel, okay. One L_C_D_ displayed.	It has on-off and volume buttons, an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours, which largely replaces the use of push buttons, and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD.
Apparently, we have to choose one or the other. if I look at what is the most expensive things, uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker. So, put minus one there, please. I'm not sure if this is legal. Okay, we're uh on target.	When it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the LCD or the speech recognition, they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget.
So, we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television. And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly. So people can can use it without any any problem.	The Project Manager introduced the project to the group.
I'm doing the interface. I'm doing the interface. It was a little confusion about my uh Okay, I'll for industrial design. And and you Norman? Uh, I'm into marketing. Um working on i. User interface. A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface. See there's a role for everybody.	They discussed and explained their roles in the project.
Well, I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh B did you send us an email about this? Do you want do you want me to send you a mail? Or you can put it in the shared folder. You get email,. Yeah, from the account manager. I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information. Yeah, so each of us has a role to do. We already have our role. So there are three kinds of designs, that's all. We have functional design, conceptual design, and detail design. I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager. So, who will be the the responsible for the functional design?	The group set an agenda for the meeting and discussed the materials sent to them by the Account Manager.
Uh. We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface. You just tell the television I want which channel. Or or you can say for example, um I want uh to list all the programme tonight. Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight. So instead of pressing the channel number, I am choosing the programmes directly. I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly. Like s uh you you you say we can use speech. The the idea of using speech to reduce the button, but uh and it's more natural. Yeah. I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control. If we are going to add a speech interface, I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it. And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself. But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function, instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel, there's a option you can choose, either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme. Yeah, yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs. We just want to retrieve the content so we can just use the service available. And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories, or sev seven. The most there are only seven buttons. So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button	They discussed several usability features: adding speech recognition and an option to choose what to watch by channel or by content, reducing the number of buttons by using the television screen to display options, and adding a light adaptation system.
Well, I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the About the design or Well, w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess. I mean working remotes we already have. This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls. What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics. And of course it should not be very costly. Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting, or What is the most important function aspect? Yeah, it should be easy to work with.	The group began a discussion about their initial ideas for the product.
Uh. We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface. I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly. Like s uh you you you say we can use speech. The the idea of using speech to reduce the button, but uh and it's more natural. Yeah. If we are going to add a speech interface, I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself. if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it.	The group could not decide if they wanted to include speech recognition in the design.
We will get information and then we'll come back in. I think that's the the things to do and uh to uh reflect about it and uh discuss it in the next meeting.	All participants were instructed to gather information for the functional design meeting.
and uh to uh reflect about it and uh discuss it in the next meeting. we will get some information in the next meeting, We will get information So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes? And we'll discuss the other other aspects. I think that's the the things to do	All participants were instructed to gather more information for the next meeting, the functional design meeting.
B did you send us an email about this? Do you want do you want me to send you a mail? Or you can put it in the shared folder. You get email,. Yeah, from the account manager. I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager. So, who will be the the responsible for the functional design? I'm doing the interface. I'm doing the interface. It was a little confusion about my uh Okay, I'll for industrial design. And and you Norman? See there's a role for everybody.	The project agenda and the participant roles were not clear to all participants at the beginning of the meeting.
But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function, instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel, there's a option you can choose, either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme. Yeah, yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea Uh, uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons. Uh to choose uh content s or channels.	The group decided to include an option for the user to choose what to watch by channel or by content or program type.
and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ So we should have specific T_V_? Well, so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television. So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years. So you have to anticipate the the future? well, not not to implement it,	There was no resolution on whether or not to allow users to use the remote to access the internet through their television, as opposed to including teletext capabilities.
Well I I think it will be a, yes, a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem. I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones. And this can allow to choose the the program, for instance without uh adding uh buttons It's going to be very slim. it's not going to take much space also. Yeah, s s speech is a important extra feature I think I mean, for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes. but only for the numbers on the channel, or volume up, volume down, brightness, contrast. And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages. Little bit more if it's with extra features. Maybe not less, but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort, I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost. The features and the cost. I mean we have to look for a trade-off. And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive, It has to be of course a very slim and small one. And next one was the size of the remote control. and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control, so What about lighting adaptive options? Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting, but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required. According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that. but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project. So any things to to discuss? I think as I	He discussed using speech recognition and ways to make it feasible for the project, small size, low price point, and incorporating teletext in different languages.
um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine, then. Well, then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel No, because you choose by channel, but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right, left, up, down, well, the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator, maybe directly, or	The participants disagreed on how to easily move through channels using the design of the User Interface Designer, which included very few buttons.
Okay, after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface, I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here. And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested, then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines, and the users send the feedbacks, and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote And next one was the size of the remote control. It has to be of course a very slim and small one. And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive, I mean we have to look for a trade-off. The features and the cost. I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost. Maybe not less, but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort, Little bit more if it's with extra features. Yeah, s s speech is a important extra feature I think but only for the numbers on the channel, or volume up, volume down, brightness, contrast. I mean, for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes. And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages. It's going to be very slim. it's not going to take much space also. And this can allow to choose the the program, for instance without uh adding uh buttons Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones. I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem. Well I I think it will be a, yes, a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a	The Marketing Expert presented several characteristics important to users.
and I think we don't need lighting adaptive, Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting, but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required. According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that.	The group decided not to include a lighting adaptation system.
So I come up with a simple design, just keep the v navigation buttons. Yes, that's a good idea, I think. We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh Well, f four five buttons, it's sufficient. It's easy to build, it does not consume much power. Oh, but you have a catch there, um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine, then. Well, then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel No, because you choose by channel, so you don't have hundred channels to choose from. but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right, left, up, down, well, the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator, maybe directly, or we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that. Uh it's gonna be small. So it'll beep if you wanna find it too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it. you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device. just give it a name and we call him. And responds to you, and	He suggested a simple design with few buttons, small size, and a locator function.
Mm. You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it. It's a good idea. We just make a small charger	The remote will be used with a recharging stand.
So I propose the easy to use uh prototype. You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing. From the technical aspect, the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller, right? And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_. What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ Yeah, all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the So we should have specific T_V_? We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too. Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay. I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because	He suggested that the televisions that the remotes are used with connect to the internet to access downloadable programs.
But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons And they are small. O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy. So you so you move to the next the next one. And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick, so we don't want that.	He showed that the competitors' remotes were too complicated.
Yeah, but well what about the the new project's requirement? I I I think we should give up with teletext, no? Well, so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television. Yeah, but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet. So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years. So you have to anticipate the the future? well, not not to implement it, but to well, to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah, in an in an easy manner, if is possible. Yeah. Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital, right.	The group discussed the new requirement that required them to omit teletext from their design, and discussed the possibility of using the remote to access the internet through the television.
So I'm working on the technical functions design. So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have. So so I found on a webs on the internet and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set. For example switch on, switch off, switch the next channel and so on and so on. So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors This are usual functionality. Ours is a bit uh different. So these are two example. One is from the other one is from, yeah, uh engineering centr yeah. This is the most competing prototypes I've found.	The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on the technical functions of the remote, and displayed the interfaces of two existing products for comparison.
I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t What is F_P_G_A_? It's a field programmable gateway arrays. So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth? Well, uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want. And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices. So this are the they have to work together? Or? Do they have to work together or two separate choice Well, th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send. Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one? And the second one is for the software. Okay, and how about the battery power? Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared? I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run, so Mm. You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it. It's a good idea. Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always. People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out. We just make a small charger Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth, if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to, right? we do not want to make it P_D_A_. Also, but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control.	He suggested that field programmable gateway arrays be used for the chip controlling software functionalities, and it was suggested that the remote be used with a recharging stand.
Right, so um I will talk about the the w working design and And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television. So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do. I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use. Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that. And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that. So, wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the. Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication. And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components, uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set. The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities One is a communication. and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well, putting things together, um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set.	The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of a remote control and showed a diagram of how they operate together.
Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one. And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control. And we have think I got a new project requirement. So I think uh teletext becomes outdated. and I think we don't need lighting adaptive, So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet, so the remote control should be only used for the the television. And of course we should have our image in the in the design. So, let's start with the the industrial designer.	The Project Manager presented the goals of the meeting and new product requirements.
But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy. We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market. we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy.	The group will ask if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy.
So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment. For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons, simple buttons	He suggested kinetic energy, a titanium case, and rubber push buttons.
So the here are some examples. So they cluster the buttons together. They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well. but this interface are kind of confusing. Uh basically there are too many buttons. So some people are propose voice recognition ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you. And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that, supposedly. Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons, Touch screen, I mean. And some people propose a scroll button. Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button. so there are a few aspects that I collected here. So s basically this deals with special users, children, handicapped people, old people, basically they are programmable, And then they also secure uh covers, to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings. But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features. I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people. And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover. Mm maybe useful for children, And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside. So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside. this is another company that provides big buttons. I see that that is useful for old people But for our product we don't need a big one because	He presented several existing products and suggested the following: large buttons; voice recognition; either push, scroll, or spinning buttons; and incorporating some customizable components.
So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system, a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data. we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here. The idea is to represent buttons as figures, diagrams, symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing. A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures.	The User Interface Designer introduced the graphical user interface to the group and suggested using an LCD screen.
Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control. So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy, hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy. We also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control. we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote. So uh it's a point to discuss. Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated, but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so. And uh this is the last point, the choice of chips. What is this single curved Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote. You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat. And the battery, is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter? Yeah the um that's the point. The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy.	The Industrial Designer presented options for each component.
so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost And also the cost for the speech recognition. Ask our R_ and D_ department. And also the scroller button, how much will it cost. So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use, where to use, and s uh and so on.	There was not enough information on the cost of several components.
But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy. We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market. we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy. Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser. It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel.	There was not enough information about the capabilities of the voice recognizer or the kinetic energy source.
Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen. You can use this screen instead of the big se screen, well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results. so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and this menu when you press the menu, in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume, then the program, then the brightness, contrast and all the stuff. And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_. I and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use, where to use, and s uh and so on. Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included.	No decision was made about whether or not the LCD screen should be included.
So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes. And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires. So seventy percent of the users, they find their remote controls very ugly, they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything. And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy. And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot. And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons, so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times. And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls. fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it. fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex. So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them.	The Marketing Expert presented that users found remotes too easily lost, complicated, and ugly.
And also the scroller button, how much will it cost.	The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and the scroll button.
We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market. we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy.	The group will find out if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy.
Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help Yeah. That's a good idea. So you are display on the screen. On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote. So that eliminates all the complicated documentation, But people are often enough looking at the help, once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff. In the case where they need help, in the case where they need help. And let us see what the market demands.	The group discussed including a help button; it was decided that it would make the device seem more complicated.
once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff.	The group decided not to include a help button on the device because it would make the remote seem more complicated.
So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them. We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control. Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen. yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy. So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote, rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it. It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control. Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you, s You can use this screen instead of the big se screen, If you re-use the existing screen, we element eliminate the L_C_D_, and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful, fancy, well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results. so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers.	He suggested the LCD screen; the group felt that it was better to utilize the user's television as a display screen, but that they would inquire about cost before deciding.
And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy.	He showed that users were willing to pay more for a fancy remote.
And also the cost for the speech recognition. Ask our R_ and D_ department. Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser.	The group will ask about the capability of the voice recognition component.
And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls. And also the cost for the speech recognition. Ask our R_ and D_ department. Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary, say eighty commands or so. And also the scroller button, how much will it cost. Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button. from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button. Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button. Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality.	The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and scroll buttons.
Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category, if it is kids, uh things like that. and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use, where to use, and s uh and so on. Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included.	No decision was made about making the remote programmable for children.
And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere, in the charger we have a small button, and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps, wherever it is. because uh every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger. Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use, where to use, and s uh and so on. Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included.	No decision was made about including a locator function, or what form it should take.
I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs, you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them. and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now we have a problem there. You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something, and if the score comes twenty four thirty five, you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five. Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so. So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent. But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers. That will be too big. And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also. Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser. It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel. but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary. Als might be you just forgot the channel name, you kno only know the number. Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary, I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example, then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel	They discussed the sensitivity of the voice recognizer to other noises; the group will ask about the capability of the recognizer.
And the third problem was to find the remote control. Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find You will listen to a peep, special peep. that's exactly what I mean by voice commander. uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control, and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger. so we have some one charger there And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere, in the charger we have a small button, and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps, wherever it is. And that's a good idea, I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command, because there are problems with a voice command. I mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged. what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button, the off button, the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen, please charge charge me. You never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger. But you can have an button for child lock. I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it, you can't avoid him. So just by pressing the button with some code, you t you put a lock onto the remote, so that he can't use even Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category, if it is kids, uh things like that. Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids I think these other four points they're	The group discussed incorporating a locator function and customization for children.
and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control. So let's see the what did you prepare. So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design S so so I discussed with Guillaume. and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes, One with and one without L_C_D_s. Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module. And detachable big buttons for all people um. S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes. Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display. How much does it cost this one? Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars Ah it's above it's above the budget. but uh it's just a prototype the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars.	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented two prototypes, one with an LCD screen and one without.
because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive. And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button. You can uh choose the direction You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here. And here the the switch that control if you want The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere. Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array? Well so it's a microphone array. Oh it's very costly, microphone array. it's just a single microphone, I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here, for instance. And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off. And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger. How many b battery is there? Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it. A_A_ rechargeable batteries. Is that two or one? Actually uh it's a flexible thing. So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone, it's alright. I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there, This button is like the mouse is like a joystick, you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button. You can move up, down, left, right, or you can do a swing. Here I present another version without the L_C_D_. So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration. The second version is also simpler, we d uh we had just uh I	They demonstrated how to navigate through the menus and presented the voice recognition and energy source components and the charging stand.
We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars. What's the price to p to produce? Well so the price to produce For uh the simplest one, say we start from four dollars to produce such a device. The without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems. Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules, and finally three dollars for the charger. So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_, which costs two dollar, you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two. We don't have all the options. so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars. it's below the the the budget.	The production costs were below budget for the basic models.
Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types? And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls? but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape What we can change is to propose the customers with skins. I think you need to look into the material.	The group could not decide how to incorporate the fashion trends into the design.
I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements, and we can finalise the product based on this discu So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings, and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_, without L_C_D_, with speech recognition interface, or without speech recognition interface, but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is, they want to have an fancy look and feel, it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold. And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative. Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative. And the third one is easy to use. since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons. Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself here you can find these are the latest fashion updates, and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable, so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable, or whatever they like. So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes. And the second thing is, and if the material, they really do not want it to be very hard, as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium, it should be somewhat spongy. you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy. Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias. One is fancy look, second is innovative, and third is easy to use.	The Marketing Expert presented three important user requirements, and also the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion.
Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that,	Not enough information was given about the agenda of each meeting.
the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system, Something like customised. Yeah for example the L_C_D_, you can take it you can put it put it back in, or you can use the other one, or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah. You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see. It's pretty flexible in the yeah price. We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons, clearly labelled, and it acts like the previous one, you just plug in and it works. the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful. Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons, powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here. Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you. The first one is the speech recogniser, again it's detachable or add-on. And then we also have security feature it's very robust, so you want more function you pay more.	They discussed their modular design.
I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect, functional aspect, but also the simplicity.	The group felt that too much focus was placed on the functionality of the remote such that they could not achieve a fancy look.
You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do, and uh which channel you want to choose and so on. H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_, up they come up with their modules, and the material, what's the material again? The titanium	They discussed the parental control module and the titanium casing.
so let's go back to our laboratory and To improve on the design.	The group did not feel that the prototype met the user requirements presented by the Marketing Expert.
Uh the teamwork was very very good. And the leadership was excellent. Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that,	The group decided that the teamwork and leadership of the project were good, but that not enough information was given about each meeting's agenda.
Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_? but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen. We haven't really uh determined what are actually actually I mean on the L_C_D_, according to what I understand from your model is, you have a joystick here, and you have L_C_D_, you just press your joystick, you get here a programme. on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now. If you have the L_C_D_, Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_. But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_. Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_,	The group had difficulty deciding what would be displayed on the LCD screen.
S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_. As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also, what about the integration of speech recognition? That's going to be an optional.	The remote will not feature an LCD screen or voice recognition.
so let's go back to our laboratory and To improve on the design. what about the integration of speech recognition? The speech recogniser is a add-on module. That's going to be an optional. S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_. As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also,	They decided to continue working on the design and to take out the LCD screen and voice recognition.
So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these, say that we have a seven point scale, from one to seven, and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this. So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_, so on this scale, if it is true, if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one, or if it is false, it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy, then you could just tell me seven. But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party? according to you designers, On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control. How do you look how does it look? D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy? I'll I'll say three or four. I think we can improve on the design. Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design. Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect, functional aspect, but also the simplicity. So I take three on with L_C_D_? So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it? Uh four. I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look. And in the sense of innovativeness, with L_C_D_. Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five, six. from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content, and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity, few buttons, we've uh A lot of functionalities. So without L_C_D_? Mm for both it's the the same innovations. So maybe I can put six to seven. actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts. then when it is without	He then led an evaluation of the prototypes according to these requirements.
so let's go back to our laboratory and To improve on the design.	The group did not feel that the remotes sufficiently met the criteria.
the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more. for example the L_C_D_, you can take it you can put it put it back in, or you can use the other one,	The remote features a modular design that allows users to add as many or as few components as they wish to the basic model.
so let's go back to our laboratory and To improve on the design.	The group was unsatisfied with the design and decided to continue working on it, focusing on a fancier design.
You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_, up they come up with their modules, We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons, clearly labelled,	The remote can be customized for adults, children, or the elderly.
and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder. So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_, uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger,	The remote has a misplacement reminder that sends a message to the television screen to remind users to put the remote back in the charger when not in use.
Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it. Um but both comes with a charger A_A_ rechargeable batteries.	The remote will feature rechargeable double-A batteries and a charging stand.
Project evaluation project satisfaction, for example. I don't know, we have to ask these question. Room for creativity. This room is a bit small, but but I think it's okay for us to work with. This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations.	The Project Manager led an evaluation of the group's experience on the project.
And the leadership was excellent. Yeah I think so. Uh the teamwork was very very good. And new ideas found. Come up with new product. Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that, We achieved uh project goal I think. that is within the budget. yes, more or less. Without without L_C_D_, without speech recognition, it will be simple. Yeah thank you for your work and	The group was pleased with the teamwork and leadership, but one participant complained that not enough information was given about each meeting's agenda.
I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control, because maybe parents will lose these uh but I mean if you have an add-ons, the kids may just uh hide the parental module Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or, The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component, and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people, and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them. So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional. But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost? I think it inc increase. because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module, but uh Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer, because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons. i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future. attracting them to come back in again and again. Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded, it would be a good thing right?	They discussed the modular design and its advantages in attracting customers.
And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls? Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types? but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all, but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all. What we can change is to propose the customers with skins. For example the i the mobile phones nowaday, they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better. we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that. I think you need to look into the material.	The group discussed how to incorporate the fashion trends; it was suggested that one shape was used, which could be customized with skins.
So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all, and uh we have a long time, just twenty-five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation. First of all I want to ask uh Mister Ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product. We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this. but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or Uh for the moment not yet. do you have some project plan, something with you or this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there. We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together. so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan, okay, Certainly by the next meeting. so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project?	The Project Manager opened a discussion about the project plan and asked the Marketing Expert to prepare an overall plan for the project.
uh good morning everybody here. And uh I want to introduce myself, uh my name is uh Shrida Daseri and uh I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now. So I want to introduce first of all uh the names and the colleagues here. my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer. My name is Ed and I do accounting. Do you also do marketing? So only accounting? And I'm Christine, and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer. So who is uh marketing, nobody in the market Marketing is uh, is me.	The group introduced themselves to each other and discussed their roles in the project.
Yes, so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine, okay, because you know what she is going to do it, okay, but you are the core because you are in the marketing, okay, So, what I prefer, okay, so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team, okay, who is using the functional design or technical design, okay, and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan, okay, how we are going to do the your sales plan, okay, Do we already have a cost limit on this, th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for, how much it's gonna sell for, that's up that's up to us to decide, eh? Yes, that's you have to decide, okay, so the best thing is you uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself, okay, and come up with the cost, and how we are going to compete in the market, okay, in the the technically, or in the sales wise, okay, the commercial wise, okay. Then uh we have to design, okay, how long it will take the whole project, okay, how much is going to cost us, and how much we are going to benefit for the company. Okay, so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan, okay, including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team, okay, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the the proper project plan. Okay, and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors, okay, depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan, okay, so you let me know. or maybe uh, you are my coordinator, am I right? I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make	The Project Manager instructed all participants to work together on their respective design plans.
Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides? Yes, I will. Yes.	The Project Manager will post his presentation to be available for all participants.
Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh, what they're building, their designs, their ideas, uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into. It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition, uh th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new, Whether it works or not, they have to first say I like this, I like the design, and then it's gotta be simple to use.	The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan: to analyze the competition and to pinpoint the target marketing group.
and uh first of all with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market, okay, I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable, it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that.	The User Interface Designer will contribute studies on user requirements to the functional design.
Christine, what about your uh the industrial design plan? Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design? Um no, I I have not begun working on the design, I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control, Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor, and um I understood that that was the project goal. Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people, So uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team, for the design? Um well, I would th think that depends on how much money you give us. Um because uh, you know, you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models. Yeah, but uh before we talk about uh the finance, okay, uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also. I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable, that's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal, and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own. So it would really would need to um you know, I don't care what it does, just so it looks cool. but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design? Well, uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month. If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be	The Project Manager asked the Industrial Designer to create a functional design plan for the device, then asked the Marketing Expert about ideas for the sales strategy.
What is the goal of the project? Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed, okay, so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting. so can you explain uh what exactly the product is? From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee, Oh I think uh, if I'm not wrong, we're making the remote control. 'cause I had two different things. I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television, and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then. So we're have to design something that is very user friendly. Something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product, because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls, we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use, 'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it.	The Marketing Expert presented the initial aim of the project: the creation of a fresh, user-friendly remote control device.
To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed, okay, and how it's going to be work,	The Industrial Designer will prepare an initial functional design.
Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh, what they're building, their designs, their ideas, Um no, I I have not begun working on the design, I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control, Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor, and um I understood that that was the project goal. Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together	The group did not receive sufficient information about the project in advance to be prepared to create a project plan in the first meeting.
So, the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design, or	The group will first work on a functional design of the device.
Okay, so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan, okay, including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team, okay, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the the proper project plan. and how we are going to compete in the market, okay, in the the technically, or in the sales wise, okay, the commercial wise, okay.	The Marketing Expert will prepare a sales plan for the product and discuss the project budget and the sales strategy.
So, the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design, or To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed, okay, and how it's going to be work, and uh first of all with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market, okay, so then we can discuss about uh further things. Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides? Yes, I will. Yes. And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me, or just send me email, or uh just come and uh knock my door, okay,	The Project Manager decided that the design plans will be discussed at the next meeting, and that the next step will be to come up with a functional design of the device.
so then we can discuss about uh further things.	The group will discuss the design plans of the three experts at the next meeting.
from the marketing yeah, from the marketing side, just to to give an idea what the management is looking for, I was looking for a a remote control to have a s I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro, with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro. For what uh I think from what we're trying to find, we're tr we're looking for, I don't think that price is exactly in the market. in the recent surveys, uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five, eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy. Twenty-five Euros, uh that's that's a preson reasonable price. Now if we're gonna take a risk, and push this up a bit, make it more expensive, then it w it could possibly sell. But, I think uh there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group, which always spends more money on trendy new things, speech recognition is requested. And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote. Obviously, we can't make a remote into a computer, but maybe simple commands. louder, softer, on, off. Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use. So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly. Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time. So maybe one word speech recognition commands, say remote, and there's a beep beep beep, But, in the cost that uh the management is looking for, that's not gonna be possible. But if it's trendy, if it's fancy, it's got some colour to it, if it's very easy easy to use, if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control, like I said, louder, softer, change channel, on, off, remote, it goes beep beep, So we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea, with the ideas of the industrial uh design. But, price obviously we have to talk about	The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan and showed that there is a demand for remotes featuring voice recognition and other capabilities; the group discussed how it could be integrated into the functional design.
what I can uh suggest to you, Christine, uh if you need some uh the technical feedback, or some training, okay, about uh this facility, especially for the speech recognition, I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_, because they're already in this uh speech recognition part, and uh if you want, I can coordinate, okay, to get some information, and uh you can uh let me know, okay, so what kind of uh the details you require okay, to add this feature in this project. we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop, apart from uh what today.	The Project Manager offered to help the Industrial Designer find companies to provide help in integrating this component.
From from your side uh, you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise. What do they want? Uh, a risk, take a risk on the market? Something that's gonna cost more, but could very easily s make a boom in the market? Because it has to be something totally different, but end of the day, you're the sales guy, It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us I don't mind to convince, okay, the management to spend some more money on the project, okay, if you can make out of The management says, okay, so they they don't want certain facilities, they want something uh new, I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree, And uh I hope I can convince the management on that,	The designers expressed that they needed more information from the board on their expectations for the product.
the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products. So, in our case, existing remote controls. We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad, but when you look, technically, at how it works, sometimes that's not the case. Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep, Um and then what the remote control should look like, in terms of the functionalities that we need, you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off. You need to change channels, both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing. You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever. the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls, in general. The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do. Um often, you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done, um which you don't necessarily always remember, especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often. here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side, you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons. The buttons, in a lot of cases, are tiny. they're labelled, but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much. Whereas, on the other side, you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed. And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it. So, I would be inclined to go sort of towards this, in terms of design, rather than this. And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons, then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons. So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit, or to a minimum, make frequently used buttons bigger	The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on product design from the user's perspective and emphasized simplicity in design.
Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include, 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table, do we actually want to incorporate all of them, or have we missed anything? Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide, maybe that would provide some guidance? I think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away? I mean, it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features, um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use, maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want, I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting, 'cause w our meeting time has run out.	She also suggested that the group make a decision on which features to include in the final product design, but the group decided to postpone it.
Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include, I think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process, do we actually want to incorporate all of them, or have we missed anything? I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away? I mean, it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features, um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use, maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want, I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting,	The group was not sure whether to proceed in the design process with all of the desired functions and eliminate them later, or to eliminate some features before creating the design concept.
and it will be slim, 'Cause, for example, in the unbreakable thing, doing something plastic would be harder, if you can add other facility, other feature, like uh unbreakable. if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control, like I said, louder, softer, change channel, on, off, remote, it goes beep beep, I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset and to keep the design basically sleek and simple. So maybe one word speech recognition commands, say remote, and there's a beep beep beep,	The remote will have a slim shape and a simple interface, include a locator function and voice recognition, and be made of a hard material.
it says individual actions, Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach. and you're supposed to keep watching the trends. supposed to work on the user interface concept, so I'm supposed to do the components concept, and eliminate them later in the process,	The designers were given their assignments: the Marketing Expert will present the marketing concept; the User Interface Designer, the user interface concept; the Industrial Designer, the components concept.
From from your side uh, you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise. What do they want? The management says, okay, so they they don't want certain facilities, I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree, And uh I hope I can convince the management on that,	There was a lack of sufficient information from the board on their expectations for the design of the remote, whether they expected a simple device or a more costly one with many features.
and you're supposed to keep watching the trends.	The Marketing Expert will present the marketing concept.
supposed to work on the user interface concept,	The User Interface Designer will make a presentation on the user interface concept.
and eliminate them later in the process, I think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting, 'cause w our meeting time has run out.	The group will discuss which features to include in and eliminate from the final design of the product at the next meeting.
and uh if you want, I can coordinate, okay, to get some information, uh if you need some uh the technical feedback, or some training, okay, about uh this facility, especially for the speech recognition, I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_,	The Project Manager will research companies that can provide the Industrial Designer with help on integrating voice recognition into her design.
so I'm supposed to do the components concept,	The Industrial Designer will make a presentation on the components concept for the product.
management come with the new proposal, and I have to discuss a few points on this. Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project. Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded, okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology. we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design. And the second one is about uh the remote control. Should be used only for the T_V_. And the third point, it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image, okay, with this new project or new product.	The Project Manager gave new requirements for the product: the remote will not include a teletext function, will only be used for television, and must show the corporate image.
I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design. I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements, and from my experience, I wanna uh, and from research I did, uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button, Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them. since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product, thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those, um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction, especially in the the uh the outside of the product I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind. you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off, you could use it for something else. But um I just took some different uh schematics and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board. personal preferences, um uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here, and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference. So something that's very very flexible and inflatable I think um it could either be you could go either one extreme, be very colourful, or you could make it clear, and um kind of blend in with things, Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof, because uh sometimes they fall into cups one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not, because half the time, I keep pushing on the remote control, and I don't know	The Industrial Designer presented  possible components to consider.
if you can add other facility, other feature, like uh unbreakable. because uh especially today, you know, you have the family and the kids, and the kids throw it if you can add the feature, okay, for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay, with unbreakable, I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product, Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials? 'Cause, for example, in the unbreakable thing, doing something plastic would be harder, whereas having something like, I dunno, steel or titanium isn't really economically viable. Titanium would be be heavy, too, um I wanted feedback, but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts. I like titanium. Expensive. It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though.	The group then discussed hard materials to include in the design.
Do you wanna take an action item to go find out? Once we get a price on it then we can market it. Then meantime you can come up with the price, how much it's cost as extra for uh the display. An and the marketing strategy, that's very important, okay.	The Marketing Expert will find out how much the display component costs and will present his marketing strategy at the next meeting.
maybe what you can do is uh, both of you, you can come up with the the prototype, okay, the model. Then meantime you can come up with the price, how much it's cost as extra for uh the display. An and the marketing strategy, that's very important, okay. So, by next meeting, so, please come up with the the prototype, okay, then uh, then we can proceed from there.	The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer were instructed to begin building a prototype, and the Marketing Expert was instructed to work on the marketing strategy as well as research the cost of the display component.
maybe what you can do is uh, both of you, you can come up with the the prototype, okay, the model. So, by next meeting, so, please come up with the the prototype, okay,	The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer will design the prototype of the remote control.
You know, maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball, and then they would squeeze it, and it would take the shape of their hand. But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote. Well, already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick. it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours. Right, you take it apart, and put on another face, take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions, millions. We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes, we might wanna um learn about um labour laws. You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap, but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries. So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device. Yeah, but we can get a production in, uh, countries like, uh, India We're here to design, come up with a nice product. but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later, okay, depends on the the quantity, okay. So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something, but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept, okay,	The group discussed the unique, custom design of the remote, and quickly talked about finding a manufacturer that could make the custom cases cheaply that still paid fair wages.
And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple, so I mean I think it's a good idea, but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be So, if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go. because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you. I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you know how much it costs, um, to to add a little display like this uh? Do you wanna take an action item to go find out? Once we get a price on it then we can market it. what we'll do is, uh, we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra, in case we go for the display.	The group also discussed whether or not to incorporate the display into the design, and decided to wait until the cost of adding that feature was known before adding it to the design.
Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material? so then we were thinking about um rubber, but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while, but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh, nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood.	The number of options for the material used for the casing was restricted; the group was left with one material that could be used for the product.
I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you know how much it costs, um, to to add a little display like this uh? Do you wanna take an action item to go find out?	There was a lack of information on how much certain components would cost.
So, it's a very short presentation, 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch, volume and channel control, the menu access button, ergonomic shape, which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded, so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls. And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea, is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size, so if someone has larger hands, you have a wider remote control. So, that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability. Um, one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it, just like you have on flip phones, so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it, especially if you have little kids around, they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off. And also um you had issues with the batteries running out, so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die. And in terms of invisible features, audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and, like you said, speech recognition. You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big, sort of in the corner and by itself, so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons. And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for, oops, channels and volume, sort of for surfing channels and then volume, so the volume would be the up and down, 'cause volume goes up and down	The User Interface Designer gave her presentation on the user interface concept for the product, and gave a basic layout of the remote's key functions.
I mean I think it's a good idea, So, if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go. but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for Do you wanna take an action item to go find out? Once we get a price on it then we can market it.	The group discussed including a display on the remote, but the prototype will be designed without a display until the Marketing Expert finds out how much it would cost to add it.
I also have a f very simple presentation, because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want. I also have uh copied a different type of remote. We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today, 'cause uh trends change very very quickly. Looking for next generation of innovation, fancy and feel-good, that's what we've been looking for, something that feels good in the hand, that's easy to use. Easy to use, has always has become has become another major interest that uh, And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology. The second two, you can see the last one is a very easy simple design. The second one, there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it, which makes it fairly hard to read, uh very hard to use. The first one, I see that they put in a display. Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up, now we're adding all kinds of things in, but with the little flip-up, if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked. Maybe the display also makes it easier to use, So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use, trendy, fancy, feels good, uh with a display, wood, designer wood, designer colours Context-sensitive instructions, depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in. Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and	The Marketing Expert presented the marketing concept and discussed including a display to facilitate use.
We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes, Yeah, but we can get a production in, uh, countries like, uh, India but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries.	The group decided to contact another company to manufacture the product that could do it cheaply yet still paid fair wages.
we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components, uh the case, the power supply, uh the means of communications with the television set. In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition, you have to have microphone well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device, it has to it has to hear the speaker so it could be in the television set, could be in the device, and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost. Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record, what's worked, what hasn't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because, course, we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us, So um for the case, um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design. Course, you know, I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable, but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore, so then we were thinking about um rubber, but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's uh goes with the board. Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while, so um we still had titanium and and wood available, but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh, the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium, So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board, uh these simple chips, but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence	The Industrial Designer gave her components concept presentation, which presented the components that will be used and how they will be integrated into the functional design.
but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept, okay, A customisable and and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case. So the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've we've deci we've determined	The group decided on the features that will be included in the final design of the prototype.
nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood. um I I'd really think we should, you know, use some of uh some really exotic woods, like um, you know uh, well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods. I think that people will might really want to design their own cases, and then they could submit their orders, kinda like you submit a custom car order, you know, and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood. Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material? Because um it gets brittle, cracks we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years. I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems, I mean it chips, it if you drop it, So so you're not convinced about the the wood, yes. I think if you re if you use really good quality wood, then it might work, the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard, extremely hard wood, Well, it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood, your type of wood. One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that,	She announced that their only choice for casing material was wood, so she suggested an idea of having customizable wood cases.
I think that people will might really want to design their own cases, you know uh, well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods. and then they could submit their orders, kinda like you submit a custom car order, you know, Well, already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick. So the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've we've deci we've determined and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case. A customisable and I think they could be rubber like they are now, What about the buttons, would Would the buttons be wood too, or	The remote will have customized wood casing and ergonomic sizing, voice recognition, a locator function, rubber buttons in a simple arrangement, an advanced chip, and a battery life indicator.
Uh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence. You can do a shipping centre somewhere, or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs. In fact, we should sell through Amazon, Or eBay, yeah. That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable, 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have, see maybe what other people have done, what the range of possibility as, And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight. The weight and feel. but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying. maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year, which could you know, feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit. I don't think that's uh not possible,	The group also discussed the distribution and promotion of the product on the internet.
Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad, this is bad, we want this done differently. Let's proceed with this model, okay, for the for the marketing direction, okay. So no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers, then we can uh go for the second generation. The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of. Well, every customer, okay, they have their own ideas, they have their own test, okay, so there's no end, there's no limit. No, but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up. I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need. well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time and A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped, when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy. so, you're right, timing is very important,	The User Interface Designer expressed concern that there would not be time under the current plan to make changes to the product resulting from consumer testing; the Project Manager decided that no additional changes would be made.
Ed, d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales? Would it be the Christmas season by any chance? The sports time. Sports season. Right before the Eur the World Cup. World soccer. World Cup soccer, Yeah, that's a good idea. but, so, I'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event That's actually good place to advertise it too. There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it, Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage. Yes, the that of course uh I will convince the management to do that, okay.	The group then discussed other means of promoting the product: launching the remote at the same time as a large sporting event or DVD release.
so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get uh the production cost less, okay, I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down.	The Project Manager will negotiate with production companies and with management to decrease the cost of production.
and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design, if we figure out it's too expensive, well then you just take it off. This is our remote control, with the flip panel as you can see. So if you lift up the panel, you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display. S And it's one of those very light, very touchable displays. Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front.	The product featured an LCD display, a flip panel, and a customizable case back.
so then let's come to the finance uh, I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget. So here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells. Uh it's optional, somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print, that's what uh we were talking about that. So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker, then uh we have the wood material, then special colour and push button. actually, our budget was uh twelve point five Euro, but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro, so we are under uh below the budget, Well we haven't come to mine yet, so we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion, yes.. It's gonna cost a long way to c you know, cost a lot of money to market it, is it? on this pr provisionary cost analysis, we do not have a L_C_ display. L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive, No we do, but it's not filled in. We don't have the price up there, you're right, sorry, yes. okay, so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote, now we're up around about twelve, twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested. Um So that means we can put the uh the L_C_D_ in, yeah. But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also, and in mine you'll see uh the problem with uh our survey, the p the possibility that how many units can be sold, what percentage of the market, etcetera etcetera Uh this is just production cost, it is not uh advertising cost, it's not transportation cost uh And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company. So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit, we're gonna have to go a long ways. so when it go into the quantity, okay, and the cost will	The Project Manager displayed the cost of all of the components, and the group decided that the current budget would not allow the addition of the LCD display.
so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get uh the production cost less, okay, so then we can save some money, okay, to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions, whatever, okay, I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down.	The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the addition of the display.
So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project. since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year. Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year, which is actually a tremendous amount. if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro, with transport, promotion, labour, because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost, transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers. At two million units, we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit. I just did a run down the evaluation of the form, the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit, the ease of use, speech recognition, cost, we've gone through these. Now, the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production. but being that the market changes very very quickly, maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now. So, now we have to come up with a decision. Can the company sell two million units? Can it sell it for fifty Euros?	The Marketing Expert gave a presentation on sales projection and showed that the current projected sales point would probably not allow the project to reach its profit aim.
Yes, the that of course uh I will convince the management to do that, okay.	He will also present the new promotion plan to management.
and uh let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over	The Marketing Expert will begin his marketing plan after production has begun.
Okay, let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype. I've done a presentation, but it pretty much covers work that we've both done, so if I'm missing anything, Christine can just correct me. from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting, we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape, so in terms of function, you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off, volume and channel control, menu control, voice recognition control, The yellow button you have is the on off button, so it's really big, hard to miss. You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume. The green are the channel changing. And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom, and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_, and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition. the material that we chose was wood, and uh the colour would be customisable, 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour. We haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed. That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um I think the microphone is on on the top, uh on the middle, the under the flip. But it shouldn't be under the flip either, because you can have the remote control closed, but you still might want to activate it by voice. my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk, okay, so then you can speak then you can close it. But if you put it on the on the flip, okay, then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible, 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised. I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up, I	The User Interface Designer presented the prototype of the product to the group.
okay then, l uh let's wait for the production, okay, then uh you can evaluate the product, I think he can promote the the brand value and the product value.	The group will evaluate the product after real units have been produced.
it can be on the side somewhere. Yeah, the sides maybe is good.	The group decided that the LCD display will be included in the design and that the microphone for the remote will be placed on the side of the device.
so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get uh the production cost less, okay, I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down.	The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the integration of the display into the design.
In fact, we should sell through Amazon, Or eBay, yeah. So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event. That's actually good place to advertise it too. There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it,	The group will work with other companies to promote the product and have it released along with other products or with an event, such as a sporting event.
So no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers, then we can uh go for the well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time and	The Project Manager decided that no additional changes will be made to the remote.
okay then, l uh let's wait for the production, okay, then uh you can evaluate the product, so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real. We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it.	The product evaluation will occur at a later time, after the production of some real units have been produced, rather than evaluating the prototype.
Uh this is just production cost, it is not uh advertising cost, it's not transportation cost uh And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company. So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit, we're gonna have to go a long ways. It's gonna be very hard to reduce. so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get uh the production cost less, okay, I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down. At two million units, we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit.	The group will have to make many changes to their original budget plans after the final cost analysis showed that their current budget would not cover the cost of all components and that the current price point would not meet the expected profit goal.
Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad, this is bad, we want this done differently. The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of. So no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. Well, every customer, okay, they have their own ideas, they have their own test, okay, so there's no end, there's no limit. No, but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up. I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need. well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time and	The group had problems agreeing on the project agenda, if more or less time should have been alotted for user testing and making changes to the design.
I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap, Well or yeah or if it's really, if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal.	Have a locator to help find the remote when it is lost.
And um and it should have multi-purpose. Yes, I I feel that all the remote should be very compact. Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_, it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also, like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system. Yeah, design should be, yeah it should be different.	It should be compact, multi-functional, different in shape/color/material.
Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_, it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also, like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system. At um twelve fifty Euros per Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that.	The group if not sure if they will have the budget to make the gadget multi-functional, but they would like to make one that would control basically all household machines.
Yeah, my name is Francina. And I'm uh an user interface And I'm a marketing person. My name is Eileen. Yeah. Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui. Um uh my role is industrial designer And as you already know I am Betty. I am the project manager for today.	Betty is the project manager, Francina is the user interface specialist, Eileen is the marketing expert, and Jeanne is the industrial designer.
Uh I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is? Yeah, my name is Francina. And I'm uh an user interface And I'm a marketing person. My name is Eileen. Yeah. Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui. Um uh my role is industrial designer And as you already know I am Betty. I am the project manager for today.	The meeting opens with the group doing introductions by giving their name and role.
I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap, Well or yeah or if it's really, if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal. maybe it should have a light so that we can, we can just recognise where it is. and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough.	They also discuss a way of helping people find the remote when it is lost- a signal, whether it is a beep or light.
It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have. Yeah, design should be, yeah it should be different. Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know.	They also agree that it should do something different that current controls cannot do and that it should be made of different colors, materials, and shapes.
The industrial designer That's you. Uh working design, yeah, it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design.	The industrial designer will work on the working design and technical function.
Yes, I I feel that all the remote should be very compact. And um and it should have multi-purpose. Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_, it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also, like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system.	They seemed to agree that the remote should be compact and have a multi-purpose functions.
The industrial designer That's you. Uh working design, yeah, it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design. so so you are the working design. So you have a working design and then a functional design. And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness, and what we just discussed in general. I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes.	Then they close the meeting with the project manager going over the tasks they are to complete and telling them they will meet again in about thirty minutes.
Here's the project finance Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro. Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro, the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro. now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it, things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing	They discuss the project budget and then talk about their experiences with remote controls.
And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness, and what we just discussed in general.	The marketing manager will look for user requirement specifications such as friendliness
Then, tool training try out the white board, participant can draw their favourite animal. You wanna go Eileen and And remember you have to press so it works.	To try out the whiteboard, each group member draws her favorite animal on the board.
so so you are the working design. So you have a working design and then a functional design.	The interface specialist will do the working design and functional design.
Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve. That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with. The same goes for the conceptual design, Detailed design, same thing basically.	They will be concerned with functional, conceptional, and detailed design.
Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro,	Company aims to profit fifty million Euro.
This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control. Uh should be original, trendy, and, of course, user friendly.	The project manager tells them they will be designing a new remote control that should be original, trendy, and user-friendly.
Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro.	Selling price will be twenty five Euro.
Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext,	They will eliminate teletext.
and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product,	They will maintain the corporate image by using the proper designs and colors.
and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the T_V_, the V_C_R_, the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.	They cannot make a device that works on the whole house- will need a focus.
can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes? Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um If we do some more research, maybe we. If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that.	However, they need to do more research on this topic.
If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that. Do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.	They do not know if their budget will allow them to include all the features they would like to such as a light emitter, clock, alarm clock, and child lock.
but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_. I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody.	Their target group is basically everybody who owns a TV.
Now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups. we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands, And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull. I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours. The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_. They have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever, that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package.	They are concerned about making the control marketable to a wide range of age groups, and have discussed making removable plastic covers so that the look is changeable.
And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands you you say that won't add too much to the budget? No no no, it won't uh I don't think it will be like, Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes? Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of Silly for children. so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations, And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons. because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature. So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too. You know, like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels, so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it. And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock	They discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children, making the buttons various shapes, and putting a display clock on the control.
Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller. in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller. It takes the power from a battery and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device, like a T_V_ or a air conditioner, something like that so. and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices. Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook. So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action, there can be no action taking to that so. like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller. And uh different shapes that we can do And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things	The industrial designer gives her presentation, talking about components, materials, and energy sources.
Um alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now. 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use, but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room. uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible, we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use, we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep, Okay, so, my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle. We have to have as few buttons as possible, because more buttons is more confusion, So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it, Um and then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.	The marketing expert resumes, talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful.
Uh okay, can can I at this point interject um something? Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered. Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext, and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_, and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product,	The project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated, and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors.
If we do some more research, maybe we. If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that. Do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not. So now I understand it's lunch break.	They close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases.
However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group. And uh what function, working design, how how does it work. Now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands, And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull. I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours. The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_. can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes? They have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever, that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package. Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um If we do some more research, maybe we.	They discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases.
As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote. uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice. and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel. one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote. and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television. And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that. And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability. and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing	The interface designer presents, talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a T-shape and add an alarm clock function.
I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires. Um I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody, um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility. So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time, if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do. because if we're gonna sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present. So it's gotta be really attractive Um and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle, A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever. Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the T_V_, the V_C_R_, the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.	The meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly, telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house.
Yeah, but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work, because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems, issues. So to get a good recogni recognising system, it's a costly thing, I think.	The group would like to include voice recognition as a feature, but they are not sure about how much it would cost.
Okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.	This will require further research by the industrial engineer.
Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting, more or less. Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working, Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time?	The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting.
Now as an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface, how the remote looks like Okay. Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television. Then it should have a next button, Then, there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television. Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour, colour of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture. Now there should be a memory switch. Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature. for example, if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel, uh th now the the uh yeah, the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel. So this is one one of the interface which can be created. A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features. Then, these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour, but they have many buttons. So you can you can design an interface which is very simple, and which is user-friendly. Yeah, so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser. Yeah, now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use. And this comes with different colours, different shapes. Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace. And the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function.	The interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces.
Uh any comments on uh her presentation? Well, um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there. But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more. No, I think her presentation was good, and she really explored all the options. Yeah. Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design.	The group comments on her presentation, and then the industrial designer begins presenting.
I have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction. like uh if we want to have different colours, blue, red, green, so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components. And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit. Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller. And the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery, this is a normal remote controller. like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins, you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um. Uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors, Actually, uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive. Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range. uh or we can use solar sells. Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery, a more ingenious uh hard dynamo, um a kinetic provision of energy, Like we can have a ma material such as plastic, rubber, wood, titanium, Uh yeah, on the scroll and the push-button, um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button? No, no, no, th the the the scrolling wheels are different,	She talks about the technical electronic components of the remote, explains how a remote works, and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control.
So it should be strong. uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery, Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range. Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip. like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls, uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before, I think. Now, nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all. So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons.	She suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable, using a rechargable battery, and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip.
Um alright, my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing, and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition, Um and my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful. Simple is beautiful. And eye-catching is important.	The marketing expert presents, talking about user preferences for a small, simple, eye-catching, cute, appealing, and functional remote.
And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular. They are more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them.	Fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year, so a soft, spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable.
And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote. I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser. This could be uh one feature which could be sellable. Yeah, but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work, because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems, issues. So to get a good recogni recognising system, it's a costly thing, I think. it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already, and then you're expecting an answer from th Okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.	The group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition, noting that if it is good quality it could be costly.
What kind of energy do we foresee? I think I think battery, and I think we all agreed on that. That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing. Bright, colourful, trendy trendy design, and strong. Trendy design, compact and strong. Not sure what they mean by supplements. Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement.	They about the power source and review the objectives of the product.
You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches.	Their coaches will send specific instructions and answer questions.
Bright, colourful, trendy trendy design, and strong. Trendy design, compact and strong.	They decided that the product should be bright, colorful, trendy in design, strong, compact, have push buttons, and contain supplement features (possibly mute button, swapping button, voice recognition).
I think I think battery, and I think we all agreed on that. That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing.	The power source will be batteries because it is cost-effective.
and the marketing expert with the product evaluation. and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design, In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay, it says here. You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches.	The project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete.
and the marketing expert with the product evaluation.	The marketing expert will do the product evaluation.
In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay, it says here.	The industrial designer and interface specialist will work together on a prototype using modeling clay.
and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design,	The industrial designer will come up with a user interface design.
Eight, eight point two. looks like we are well within budget. Um I just realised one thing. In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser. I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty.	The group spent 8.20 euros on their product, but they almost forgot to factor in voice recognition, which may cost more than the 4.30 euros remaining.
So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.	They will have to settle for whatever level of quality that 4.30 euros can buy.
And then um uh for the for the led, for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green	Light emitting diode is flourescent green.
Um I just realised one thing. In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser.	However, while the marketing expert is doing the product evaulation the group realizes that they neglected to calculate voice recognition into the financing.
Okay now on the financing we bring up the Um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need. Uh electronics, simple chip on print? I guess it's double curved. And then we have to interface push buttons. Eight, eight point two. looks like we are well within budget.	They goes over finances and are pleased to find that they are well within budget.
Eight, eight point two. In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser.	In their cost evaluation they got 8.20, not factoring in the voice recognition feature.
Now we have included another feature that is the mute button Now uh we have included the switch on and off button. Then we have included one to nine buttons We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume. Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button. We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button.	Its features will include an on/off button, two mute buttons, nine channel buttons, two buttons for increasing/decreasing the volume, two buttons for scrolling up/down channels, a menu button in the center which controls the color/sharpness/brightness of the picture, and a swapping button.
Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now, uh one being good and seven being the worst. Yes I think uh shape is one. And how about on size? I think I would give it at least a two. Colour, I gave it a one. One, one, one, okay. And how about the feel? I'll give three. Uh maybe two, And the next is functionality I'll give it a three. It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product.	They rate their product on its shape, size, color, feel, and functionality.
Yes, it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols.	Channel buttons numbered, rest of the buttons have symbols indicating function.
I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty. So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.	Their cost had been 8.20 Euros and they have  4.30 left to cover it, so they decide to settle for whatever quality it will buy.
like before we uh I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting It should have nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, colour contrast, sharpness etcetera. Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote. The industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue. She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colourful. uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore. The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition, has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small, easy to use and it should be eye catching. And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser, should be trendy design, compact and strong,	The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting, detailing the main points of each person's presentation.
and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape. A shell shape.	It includes a remote holder in the shape of a shell.
Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber	The case will be made of plastic and the buttons of soft rubber.
Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons	The remote is a snail shape with bright colors, blue and yellow with multi-colored buttons.
what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb, I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place. The colour's very attractive. Yes, it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols. and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape. A shell shape. I think voice recognition is our big selling point I think we have to, we have to dwell on on on the appearance.	The group discusses this proposed model, approving of the small size and look of it.
This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build. Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons it's blue in colour Uh and also compact in shape. Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber Now we have included another feature that is the mute button Now uh we have included the switch on and off button. Then we have included one to nine buttons We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume. Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button. We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button. And then um uh for the for the led, for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green And at the end, it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly.	They do the prototype presentation which includes a model of the remote control.
Uh and also compact in shape.	Compact in size.
personally I think uh I'm pretty happy. and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project? I think you've done a good job, Miss leader. Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more, yeah, I think we we did, uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here. So I I thank you all very much.	They are happy with the creativity, leadership, and teamwork within the group, and close the meeting by thanking one another.
Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity. Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy? We can always improve, yes. so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case. If we want to have more features than that. Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech. maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons, instead of having two mute buttons. Uh, um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here	They discuss the project process, talk briefly about adding more features, and one member suggests eliminating a mute buttons and include a diffferent feature.
I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty. So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.	They decide to settle for the level of quality the remaining 4.30 euros will get them.
Uh we can do it international,	The focus will be on an international market.
Um as you can see, we um for our remote control, a selling price is uh twenty five Euros. Our selling price.	The selling price will be 25 Euro.
Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros,	The production cost cannot exceed 12.50 Euro.
As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board. Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side. Here are some functions. You can save. uh these functions we don't have anything to do with, only undo, you can undo a little uh piece of drawing. A blank new document for each person. Uh select a pen, eraser. Uh then we've got our pen. This pen. It's really funny You can also select the current colour and the line width. and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there. We've got our shared folder, But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already, so if you have a document you wanna show, just open it from the folder. Here is a simple tool bar. it's save, print, move back or forward one page. You can switch between the different drawings. And then we're going to try out the white board. We're going to uh draw animal. And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics. Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours, and different line width. You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child. Because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow. 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up. we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate. Now you'll see my drawing capabilities. you have to do it real slow. I was trying to draw a dolphin, And then you can undo Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down. now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you. Gonna use a different line width. Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width, I think. You have to go really slow when you're writing. Um I'm	The project manager introduced the smart boards to the team and led the team members in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and described why they liked the animal.
This is our agenda. Uh we have our opening acquaintance, tool training, project plan description closing. then I can take some notes Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while. but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down, just write it down. Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control. It has to be original, trendy, and user friendly. Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through. First is functional des uh design, individual work, meetings. After the functional design, then the conceptual design and the detailed design. The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design, uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design. Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept and user interface design. And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification, trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation. But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings.	The project manager then described the upcoming project and the roles of each team member.
And we can all work uh on our own projects.	The team members will work on their individual projects
move along to the project finance. Um as you can see, we um for our remote control, a selling price is uh twenty five Euros. Our selling price. Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros. Uh we can do it international, so we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures, and different kind of trends as well. Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros, just try to remember these points. Selling price twenty five, profit aims fifty million um, but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on. And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros. that's leads us to our little discussion. does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls, and I mean not the ordinary mote controls, but also a little bit different ones? Like you can use for other? No, me neither. kind of broad T_V_ at home, and a D_V_D_ player, so we got like a lot of remote controls, one for the T_V_, one for the video recorder, one for the D_V_D_ player. And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all. I've I've got one at home. And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it, I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well. we've we want different functions uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red. And it also operates on infra-red, and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor. so you have to got the little device inside your room, Think it has to be shock proof Sure, yeah. my remote control tends to fall a lot. Waterproof, Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it. how much is left in the battery. But maybe just a little LED,	The project manager briefed the team on the project budget and selling prices for the remote they are to create and led them in a discussion on their experiences with remote controls and what features they would like to include in their product.
Waterproof,	The remote will be waterproof.
But they'll also really drag up the production costs, so think we'll have to see about that too.	Cost of a battery status display.
I don't know if you've noticed, but uh we're working for Real Reaction. We put fashion in electronics, uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself. Um have you all seen the corporate website already? Have you seen any flaws in it? I think I found one. But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction.	The project manager briefly described the company the team works for and discussed the corporate website.
First I will introduce myself. I'm Bart, My name's Frank. let's start off um with a little presentation. Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting. You can see there are a few cameras here. They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice. is there a project documents folder? There are some notes in it already I see, some documents.	The project manager introduced himself to the team and then acquainted the team with the audio and video equipment in the meeting room.
I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.	The remote will be able to control multiple devices.
Think it has to be shock proof	The remote will be shockproof.
User Interface Designer the user interface concept, and the trend-watching.	The user interface designer will work on the user interface concept and trend-watching
Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept,	The industrial designer will work on the components concept.
I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions. Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product. Um 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus, the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim. In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control. So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it. Besides that, I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small. But I mean if I s if I see this, it's I think we're just gonna go for another Standard remote. I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons Uh if we put a lot of effort in those, we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons. Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus, fifty plus, it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now. But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market, that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it. I think that if we're If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um I don't know if you've heard about it in the news, the the elderly mobile phone? if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money, I think. We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality. Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well. But only if uh if it won't higher the	The team then discussed teletext, the target demographic, the buttons the remote should have, the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly, an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost, LCD screens, and language options.
I've got a presentation about the working design. Um first about how it works. Everybody knows how a remote works. The user presses a button. The remote determines what button it is, uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_. The T_V_ switches to the frequency, or what function it is. we've got um the the plate. It gots conductive disks for every button. When the user presses a button, a signal got sent, goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_. this is a schematic overview. You've got the buttons. The power source. And uh when a button gets pressed, its goes to the chip. I think we should use default materials, simple plastics. Keep the inner workings simple, Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design and the user interface, and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product. it's, in my idea, it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself. so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements. we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_. Um that's because uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big, if we wanna have it uh for more functions. Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext, because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past. Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus. Uh that's the the market we have to to to target, because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers. And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product. So it has to be visible in our design, in the way our device works.	The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by.
Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty, maybe. Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example.	The user target group consists of adults age sixty to eighty.
we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_.	The remote will only be used for televisions.
I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros. N I I don't think so. Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen. S um it's uh not uh in colour or something. Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much, um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen,	Cost of a touchscreen.
I've been looking at uh the user interface of it. Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it. Um I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control. I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control. Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it, Um about uh interface Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television, uh stereo. But uh it must be uh user-friendly. you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh Yeah. Uh uh uh Yeah. In one um remote control. you can see, this is uh quite simple uh remote control. but uh This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons. what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are. like uh the on-off uh button. Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button. My personal uh preferences um. Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device. And um here you've got a s kind of a display. It's a touchscreen. you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh. And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device. you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device. We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh Everybody uh have to use it so Uh ol even even old people um young people. we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large. I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros	The user interface designer pushed for a user-friendly interface with large buttons, a display function, a touchscreen, and the capability of controlling different devices.
In different languages, you know. adapt it to different cultures. And with uh the little screen in it, which explains the buttons. You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to	The remote will be made to accommodate different languages.
But it might be a good idea to make a docking station. And this would, could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep. So you'd know where it is in the room. And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in. Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred. This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five. This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.	The marketing expert also brought up the idea to include a docking station to prevent the remote from getting lost and the idea to include an LCD screen.
it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it,	The remote will be easy to learn.
Uh now we're going um into the functional design. Then our agenda. first the opening. Uh this time I will take the minutes. Uh you're going to have a presentation. All of you. Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations. So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation, and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include. My name is Freek Van Ponnen. I'm the Market Expert. We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls. Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire. Uh in addition we did some market research. Uh see what the market consists of. What ages are involved. these are three quite astonishing results, I thought. uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly. Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control. Um in addition remotes were not very functional. Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control. And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room. Then we did some research to the most relevant functions. Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy. The power button got a nine. And teletext got a six and a half. Then there are some one-time use function. That uh audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons. Which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance. Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently. One hundred and sixty eight times per hour. Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f	The project manager stated the agenda and the marketing expert discussed what functions are most relevant on a remote, what the target demographic is, and what his vision for the appearance of the remote is.
If we're able to really bring an innovative product. which would explain a button if you press it.	The remote will be fancy.
it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it, Few buttons, we talked about that. Docking station, L_C_D_. Um general functions	The remote will feature a small LCD screen.
if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money, I think. Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty, maybe. If we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people, we can target the real elderly people. Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example. But I'd have to look into that a little more.	Whether the user target group should be people age 60 to 80.
I think it's very important in the in the design. You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places. But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_, you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible. you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station. I think, mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons But I don't think we should spend very much time in that. Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have? And if the remote stays rather small, it should be possible we're just gonna focus on the extras? I think so.	Whether to focus more on the layout of the buttons or the docking station.
Few buttons, we talked about that. Docking station, L_C_D_. Um general functions	The remote will have a docking station.
maybe we can implement the scroll button? Just look if you look at telephones. The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast. And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it. If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt. So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout.	Whether to include a scroll button.
Few buttons, we talked about that. Docking station, L_C_D_. Um general functions	The remote will only have a few buttons.
Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well. But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost,	The team will implement teletext in their design if it does not cost too much.
But do you need the buttons for one to zero. Think if you're gonna include teletext you do. maybe we can implement the scroll button? Or a joystick like? But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_, you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible.	What buttons and functions to include on the remote.
Besides that, I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small. But I mean if I s if I see this, it's I think we're just gonna go for another Standard remote. if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus, fifty plus, it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now.	The user target group of adults age forty and up is quite small.
But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus, the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature within the next like twenty years is very slim. In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control. So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it. Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well. But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost, But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles. I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext. I think that's a good idea as well, especially for the subtitles. Is anybody um really against teletext?	Whether to include teletext in the design despite the new requirement which indicates that the team is not to work with teletext.
So check out the corporate website maybe. It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote.	The team members will look at the corporate website.
that brings us to the discussion about our concepts. Um first I think we can talk about the energy source, uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget, I think. We could use the basic normal battery. Uh a hand dynamo. there there are four options. But I don't think that's really an option. Uh solar cells. But not every room is very light Or the kinetic energy. And how exactly does the kinetic energy work? y you basically shake your remote, and then it powers up. personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it. And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete. And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product. you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there. Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more. I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place. And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms. So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place. And also what you said. Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote. But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station. So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push, and then it starts beeping. And then we can we can still use the voice recognition, but maybe then for only the the channels. I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price? Mm I don't have any information on pricing. Um we also um asked if w they would, if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control. you can see here, our	The team then discussed and made decisions regarding energy sources, speech recognition, LCD screens, chips, case materials and colors, case shape and orientation, and button orientation.
So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one.	The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together
The user interface design, it's the same story. And product evaluation.	The user interface designer will continue with what he has been working on.
let me just choose for the battery. but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good.	The remote will have a docking station.
But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess. It's a bit higher percentage, here the question was, would you prefer it. And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use. And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use. I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use, with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it. Because it's just uh some extra information, Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition.	Choosing between an LCD screen or speech recognition.
Because it's just uh some extra information, I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use, with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it.	Whether to implement an LCD screen on the remote.
uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget, I think. personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it. And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete. And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product. you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there. Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more. I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place. And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms. So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place. in that case we could use kinetic uh energy, but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good. And much cheaper as well. And that's the best choice. let me just choose for the battery.	Whether to use kinetic energy or a conventional battery with a docking station which recharges the remote.
I suggest um the single curved,	The case will be single curved.
I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days. Um we've done some market research. We distributed some more enquetes, questionnaires. And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends. Um most important thing is the fancy design. Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor. Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design. By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls. Um about half of, half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use. Um for our um group, we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old, this is um, these factors are slightly more equal. Uh the older people prefer dark colours. Uh they like recognisable shapes, and familiar material. And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people. Um this leads us to some personal preferences. Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room. Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs. Just keep it simple the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest, because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control. Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be, the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped. So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station. This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people. So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station. Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions, one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel, and one with a grey-black colour. The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people. People with more money.	The marketing expert discussed his personal preferences for the design of the remote and presented the results of trend-watching reports, which indicated that there is a need for products which are fancy, innovative, easy to use, in dark colors, in recognizable shapes, and in a familiar material like wood.
It's the conceptual design meeting. And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components. Uh conceptual specification of design. And also trend-watching. Um but first I'll show you the agenda. Uh first the opening. Then we have three presentations. Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts. Then a little uh thing about the last meeting. Uh these are the points um we agreed on. The requirements and the target market. Uh requirements are uh teletext, docking station, audio signal, small screen, with some extras that uh button information. And we are going to use default materials. And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers. um I suggest let's get started with the presentations.	The project manager opened the meeting and recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting.
About the components design. Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or, a as an optional thing, a kinetic energy, like in a watch, But if we choose for that option, the docking station would c become obsolete. So I don't think it's really an option. Uh for the casing, uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing, single or double curved casing. It's really up the the design that we're gonna use. Uh as a case supplement, we could um, I thought of that l later, uh a rubber uh belt, like a anti-slip. Uh for the b buttons, we can use plastic or rubber. And the chip-set, um it says simple here, but it should be advanced, because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen. And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed, um people like wood, but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image, unless we would start two product lines. Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy. But depends on what we want. Um for the case, uh the supplement and the buttons, it really depends on the designer.	The industrial designer discussed which options he preferred for the remote in terms of energy sources, casing, case supplements, buttons, and chips.
uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface. Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons. that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design. just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions. finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control. Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition. only uh buttons uh for uh sound, um for uh on-off, um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down. we uh need some uh new a attractive functions it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles. overall um user-friendly. using uh large large buttons. Um It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition. Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control, you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal. And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something, you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh. Um I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles, um just one button to keep it uh simple. Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles. Um double push push um, if double click, um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles, for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles. we've got um the buttons we have to use. The on-off, sound on-off, sound higher or lower, um the numbers, uh zero to uh uh nine. Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel. Um also	The user interface designer discussed the option to include speech recognition and which functions to include on the remote.
wood is a lot more expensive to produce. Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey. Or both? Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive, And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour. But with colour was a lot more expensive? Or? I'll have to uh research. It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape.	Using wood for the case.
Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case. I think that's a very good option. everybody's okay with the changing covers? I think that's a good uh good option.	The remote will have changeable case covers.
So it's gotta be advanced. That brings us to the chip.	The remote will use an advanced chip.
but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good. let me just choose for the battery.	The remote will use a conventional battery and a docking station which recharges the battery.
if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people. So maybe we should just re-focus. Just put it on the market for everybody.	The revised prototype will probably be targeted to a younger one, or even across the population.
I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long. I was thinking, maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button. Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers.	All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype.
that brings us to the project evaluation. Did we move through the right phases, you think? Along the process? Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier. In the design phase. So lack of information about prices. The tasks are very structured,	The project process was deemed well-structured, although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage.
if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people. So maybe we should just re-focus. Just put it on the market for everybody.	A suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval.
maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little. but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros. I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote.	Raising the budget was not an option, although it was promoted as an idea throughout the meeting.
Is the company company recognisable? Yes it is. And they wanna put fashion in their products. Uh in the slogan of the company. And we have the removable front cases.	The remote was also recognisable as a fashionable Real Reaction product.
Was there room for creativity? Not too much. No. It's because of the finance sheet. Yeah. Yeah, there w there was enough room, but the finance uh And I would've liked to go for the younger users also. And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own. Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions? Yeah? Teamwork? Did it work out? Working together? Also, you two of you with the uh last phase?	Teamword and leadership were good, but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints.
Only the docking station, I guess. Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic. it's not even taken into the price.	It is not clear whether the budget will allow for a docking station to be produced along with the remote, as it isn't included in the costing sheet.
I did some literature study study, and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier. Translated it into criteria, Um, is the remote fancy? The shape, look and feel. Innovative? What new functions are there? Uh, easy to use? Uh, learnability is a very important factor here. Uh, is it functional? And the cost. The target group. Is the remote really for the group we're making it for? I have to say this was a little hard, because the minutes of our last meeting were not here. that's because my pen failed to upload his data. Is the design fancy, on a scale of one to seven? We all go for six? Um, is the design innovative? I think so, Seven? Is the design easy to use? Mm. Not really. I would say four. Four or five between. Between four or five. Is it functional? Yes. Do we have too many functions? No. Think it's uh seven. and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control? Like it getting lost and R_S_I_ influences? Mm, we haven't thought of that one. Think we do. Are the production costs within the preset limits? they are now. Does the design fit the group of focus? I think that's a three. I think with our new radio button, I think it's uh I think it's better. I still I think it's too m too fancy. Too too flashy. I would give it a four. I think I'd go for two. we have the logo there. These are seven factors times seven is forty something. Two? Forty one out of forty nine. That's Around eighty percent. I think that's a pretty nice score.	It was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (6), technological innovation (4), functionality (7), consideration of the target group (3).
I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire. I think. I think I'm going to make our final presentation now. And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation. Summary of the project. Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again? Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire.	The project manager will prepare the final presentation, while the rest of the group will fill in a questionnaire.
I will move on to the finance part, And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros. I don't know if I've filled in correctly, so just correct me if you see uh something wrong. I counted two batteries. But maybe we can also use one. Since it rechargeable. That's two Euros off. We need the advanced chip. Here we have the single curves. Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro. Um, but I think the single curved is good for design, and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control. Then we have the case material supplements. It's plastic. It's the cheapest one we need. But then the biggest costs are the buttons. So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low. Let's fir first count the buttons we have now. Uh seventeen. Uh with the help button. I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long.	One rechargable battery, single-curve form and plastic case, brought the total cost to 17 Euros.
But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people, who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is. With only five buttons on it. And a scroll-wheel. Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero. I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel. This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell. 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff. This is not familiar for them. But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios. Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels.	The non-standard interface (few buttons, scrollwheel) makes the remote unsuitable for older people - the original target group.
this is what me and Richard came up with. The default spot for the on-off button. The mute button just below that. Then there's the volume and channel selectors. Simple plus-minus button. Uh we thought of a help button. If you hold it and you press another button, uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen. Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons. A button for teletext. A button for the subtitles. And the company logo. So it's rather simple prototype. Um, is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality? Um, when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page. Uh, that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred. Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons. But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel. S so uh the shifting uh button. Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext, and shifting uh down. So I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple. Uh just a few buttons and large buttons. But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons. So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons. I think if you look at most controls, they've got more buttons than this. the on-off button, it's it's a necessity. The volume and channel buttons, you need you obviously need those those. The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice. I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does. Uh, or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh you can't leave out the number buttons I guess. Uh teletext and subtitles	Along with buttons for numbers, channel selector, volume, mute, on-off, teletext, and subtitles, the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information.
I still think we should go for the single curve design.	The case will be plastic and will be made in single-curve form.
But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people, who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is. I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel. But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios. Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels. 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff. This is not familiar for them.	It was suspected that many would not know how to use a scrollwheel, even though it does resemble a radio tuning button.
I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long. Uh, d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each, can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button? I think so. Yeah. With only five buttons on it. And a scroll-wheel. Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero. And just um If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel. So we make one for the volume, one for the channel. Plus scroll. we can leave the teletext in if we want. So we can decrease this one to four buttons.	The remaining buttons were one for channel selection, one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel), teletext, on-off and the help button.
Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers. If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display. Until you've got the right number, then you push it. That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also. Integrated scroll-wheel push-button. but then you you can push uh some other button as well. Yeah. That's right. So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second, then it g turns to that channel.	To reduce this cost, it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel.
In this meeting we will discuss our final design. But first um we will do the this is prototype presentation. this is what me and Richard came up with.	In the detailed design meeting the team created a prototype.
So we make one for the volume, one for the channel. Plus scroll. can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button?	Standard buttons like the ones for teletext shortcuts were considered superfluous.
If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display. And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen, which can provide extra information. How to use the scroll wheel. How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles.	An LCD screen will be providing functional information, and context tips when using the scrollwheel.
Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control. Fir the first thing is th the functional design, We have to look what the needs are, the effects of the functional design, and and how the mm the the remote control works, so that's where we're going to look in the functional design, The the second thing is the conceptual design, that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface. And we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market. And the third thing is uh the detailed design it's exactly how it looks and whatever.	He presented an agenda for the rest of the project.
these are two smartboards, with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one. And you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map. what we're going to do first is um You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen. and um and say why it's your favourite animal. first have to show you, maybe you can come here to have a look how it works. Use pen format. and a different colour can use here line width ten. Just draw slowly, because otherwise it won't work. It's a very nice elephant, you can see. It's a bit slow you can see, this is a bit annoying. and then uh what's the colour? How do I do It's in format. Just make a new blank new blank page. Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back, let's make it um a dog. I make a cat of it. I just draw too quick I think. I thought these pens would be just um uh you write it down and you download it to Word, but you actually got to write on the paper. but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word, but it's just a picture. Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word. it's not that cool as I th thought it would be. Now we just have to save everything,	The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room materials by drawing on the board.
Hello. Hello. you all read what we are going to do or not? We're gonna make a remote control. I just made a a simple uh presentation. that's my name,. Uh we're going to make uh a remote control, are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting. You know, this is about twenty five minutes, this meeting. it has to be original, trendy, user-friendly	The Project Manager introduced himself and the project to the group.
My laptop is crashing. Uh actually my laptop doesn't work, Okay. I think it works. How does this work? Press F_ eleven. Just draw slowly, because otherwise it won't work. It's a bit slow you can see, How do I do	The group had some difficulties setting up their computers and using the smartboard.
Yeah, it probably would be universal. I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros, I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros we we just say we just say that's universal remote control. And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player so a lot of buttons on the remote control.	They decided to make the remote a universal remote.
what what what's a remote control, it's just a black thing with some buttons on it, we can try to make it special. Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear, And how big should it be? It shouldn't be too big, but I don't think we can make it too small, We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think. Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem. maybe more trendy. Fold open, where you can see uh more options. I think something uh on top, just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often. O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control. Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control? or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small. But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it. And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control, because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken. And if you have a touch screen in it, it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile. You can put games on your remote control. Whatever.	They discussed the form of the device; it was suggested that the device could have a folding-open design or a touch-screen interface.
Ma maybe a home station. Uh should you put it in a recharger but yeah, we have to look at the price now I think. because maybe it's too expensive. Uh if you th look at the market, it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it, but a home station is uh a really good idea, The option, just the option, that's cool.	The group discussed energy source options but could not decide between using standard batteries or a recharging stand.
what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros. And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros, so we have to uh use a big market in Europe. The production cost are about half the price of selling price, can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million,	The Project Manager discussed the projected price point, profit aim, and production cost for the project.
Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert, the user requirements uh specification, do I need to think as a user, what's in the market, I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_, a D_V_D_ player, all that things. uh what kind of uh buttons do you have.	The Marketing Expert will present the user requirement specification and will research which devices the remote will control.
we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything, my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control? that's a good question. Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television, we sell it uh apart.	The group discussed their initial ideas about the product design.
Yeah, it probably would be universal. we we just say we just say that's universal remote control. And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player	The group decided to make the remote a universal remote.
We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting, Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert, the user requirements uh specification, do I need to think as a user, what's in the market, I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_, a D_V_D_ player, all that things. uh what kind of uh buttons do you have.	The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification and to research which devices the remote will control.
And uh how about the batteries? Uh should you put it in a recharger Ma maybe a home station. but yeah, we have to look at the price now I think. uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger? if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive, but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing. because maybe it's too expensive. Uh if you th look at the market, it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it, but a home station is uh a really good idea, because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is, Maybe uh use it as a separate option. Sell it uh separately. and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station, or you can change your batteries, The option, just the option, that's cool.	They discussed energy source options and could not decide between using standard batteries or a recharging stand.
Uh I I set something on paper already, size, looks, uh usable, uh the buttons on usable places, uh the the on off button must be on top, uh it has to lay good in the hand, does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control uh if if we want to make it special, we probably have to do a lot of testing, if it really works. you can um have uh the basic things on the same place, like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume uh obviously on t on top, so you can see. so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it, it should be clear as well. But the rest is uh you don't use that often, And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open, Uh on on top are the the basic options on top, basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so, maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh Mm. If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control. So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square, just normal remote control. Just think about it.	They also discussed how to make the remote look more unique; it was suggested that the remote could feature the folding-open design to hide complicated functions on the inside of the device.
we can try to make it special. Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem. where you can see uh more options. I think O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control. Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control? But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it. And if you have a touch screen in it, it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile. And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open, maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh Mm. If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control. So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square, just normal remote control. Just think about it.	The group discussed ways in which they could make the remote look unique but could not decide if the remote should have a unique folding-open design or if it should be made in a more standard, square shape.
so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control, I I think we can speak, uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly, Yeah, I tho I think that's not usable. I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition. Okay, no speech recognition.	The remote will not feature speech recognition or an LCD screen.
we can make the normal one also a normal light. Not a LED light, but as a normal one. Uh if you if you use the buttons, uh both of them works. Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push. Yeah, I think so. If you press something, it lights up for a few seconds, It's the same as the telephone. Yeah.	The remote will light up when a button is pressed, much like a mobile phone.
We definitely should use it. Um Uh when you use teletec teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one. but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control. I use te teletext every day, I think. we just keep it one level then?	The remote will feature teletext capabilities, and the teletext buttons will be included on the main interface.
I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only. it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly. All these points uh we have to look at. The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people. So we have to look at that as well. 'Specially old people, maybe bi bigger buttons or something, So make it just a different colour or different shape,	The Project Manager announced that the remote should only control television, and that the marketing should be targeted towards ages 40 and above.
And um the the forty plus people, I already told you. Oh, this is a problem. Oh sorry about that. The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty. So it should be flashy or just more interesting. that's It changes things. That kinda changes the whole situation. then we have to make some nice features. but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext.	There was a misunderstanding about the target user group that forced the group to reevaluate their decisions on several components once they received the correct information.
I've used a marketing report on uh the site. Uh I think you've uh read it too. Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site. I didn't get it uh anyway. I I was the only one who get it. it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users. And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof. I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings. Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly. so we have to make a beautiful remote control. Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy. Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good. Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at. Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot. I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons. The last point is quite an interesting fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons. And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one, we should have the ten percent on the on the top, Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something. Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system, so when you clap your hands it will beep or something. Uh you must find it uh quickly. Uh. Maybe just a button on the home station. So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station. we can uh combine that. Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new	The Marketing Expert presented the results of a lab study on users of remote controls, and showed that users want a fancier, less complicated remote that does not get lost easily.
that's not very good, because I thought about television, D_V_D_ player, stereo and V_C_R_. But it's already out of the question, this. Um my point is, well, I If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television, I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros.	The new requirement that the remote was only to control television forced the group to change some of their initial design ideas.
we have uh a new uh age of forty plus. But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients? so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control, I I think we can speak, uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly, because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros.	The group decided not to use speech recognition or an LCD screen to target the older demographic.
Technical functions design. But um we have elderly people, so we need to keep it simple. Not too full, like uh Jens already said, only ten percent is being used. what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff. the options that we put on there should be easy to use, and 'cause you have more room then, and for elderly people big buttons. Uh an icon on it or text on it, so it's very clear what that buttons does. Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet Of functions I could think of. Uh volume, channels, the the basic according to. Just one two three etcetera. Uh text service options. Um basic on-off. play, pause. I dunno if that's usable miss Did I miss any other buttons, basic buttons? that's the only th the only thing you need. Uh uh the p uh next and previous. Li like a web browser, Six seven eight or five. But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before. Like a web browser back button. but I think it's all too difficult for old people. just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time. I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons. Yeah, the ten plus button. Just uh one one pressing, or quickly after each other. w wouldn't it be a problem to uh Because you h have to be fast enough. But I think that's in the T_V_ as well. That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it. So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons. It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two. So if you have a universal T_V_ controller, you needed one button that has two uh stripes. Most things in	The User Interface Designer discussed the button functions and how to make channel-changing easier.
It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two. So if you have a universal T_V_ controller, you needed one button that has two uh stripes. So we have to understand what patterns are used to, you know, to make it universal. So that it can be used with all the T_V_s. We have to really understand what patterns are used, Otherwise it won't work. we have to uh make buttons for that as well, So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to, y you know, to An automatically search function for each television, or something. I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works. I I use a universal uh remote control, And you have to put in a number, I have a modern one. And the modern one you you uh you type uh search, And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off. And then you know, oh it it's the right one.	The group did not reach a decision on how to ensure that the remote would recognize all brands of televisions.
L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think. And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control, I I don't y you'll use it often, because you can see on the television wh what channel you I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular. because the Like in the mobile phones, usability is not that good I think. But uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition. Yeah, I tho I think that's not usable. That's very That's fancy. That's cool. Only the numbers, only numbers. Uh furthermore nothing. But only the numbers, one to twenty or something. Yeah, maybe we have to integrate that as well. If it's possible. I don't think it's very expensive actually. I didn't have information about that. And and and does it have to work only in English, or in Dutch too or that's a problem, Uh only in English. Only in English I think. it's probably my job to figure that out, Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever then th we have to think about that. Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that. We have short time to to put it on the market, In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing. I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition. A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke, and the T_V_ turns uh to one. And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one, or something. Not just one, Okay, no speech recognition.	The group again discussed the possibility of adding speech recognition and LCD screens to the design but decided that it was not feasible.
Do we, do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything? Yeah, I think so. If you press something, it lights up for a few seconds, It lights up when it's dark? If you push something, it it all lights up. it it mustn't work all the time. It uh uh it have to work only when you use it. if you use one button, it must turn uh on for twenty seconds, and then it must turn off. It's the same as the telephone. Yeah. Uh when you use teletec teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one. but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control. Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something. Because you ne almost never use it. but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext. I use te teletext every day, I think. And I think, uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons, we just keep it one level then?	The group decided to have the remote light up when used and is including teletext.
Trendwatching. you know what you have to do.	The Marketing Expert was instructed to report on trendwatching.
you know what you have to do. Trendwatching.	The Marketing Expert will prepare a report on trendwatching.
Could I think of favourites? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number. But if you could make a new option, that you just have to press one button but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel. So you might as well remember the number. Maybe i maybe it's too complicated, I would find it handy, I think, when you just press one button and you get on six six six. But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button? If I use my telephone, I never use those buttons to to to call If I don't do it, maybe old people They don't like new features. Right.	The group decided not to include programmable "favorites" buttons.
the working design. The method I used is uh search the web. Just the web page provided. Um basically what happens is you press a button, uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button, uh like a switch. And by closing that certain circuit, the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed. Then the chip produces a pattern. Like a Morse code And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_. Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light. And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_. we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it? Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting? Red's l shows up like something's wrong, and green is like it's okay, on most uh uh remote controls it's red. Um the energy source is uh the battery, basically. Um that's connecting to all the components. the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed. when you press a button, a switch get closed. So the chip knows what button you pressed. And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb. So that's the LED, L_E_D_.	The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of the device.
The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons. I I think uh the batteries will be uh a little we have a recharger in it, If we can still make that then It's just to indicate something's on. That it's working. we can make the normal one also a normal light. Not a LED light, but as a normal one. Uh if you if you use the buttons, uh both of them works. Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push. So you see green if you push that button. Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then. But does it make any difference for the energy you use? i it it will look different, Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons? Yeah, w around the buttons, or in the buttons even. The same as a telephone, or a mobile phone, or what do you mean? It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much. Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well. It's only few LEDs. Only four or something. Four LED. But if we use a battery station, Yeah, that's a good idea, okay.	The group discussed having the remote light up when used.
And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern. So we have to understand what patterns are used to, you know, to make it universal. So that it can be used with all the T_V_s. We have to really understand what patterns are used, Otherwise it won't work. we have to uh make buttons for that as well, The chip um uh is producing the pattern. So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to, y you know, to An automatically search function for each television, or something. I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works. I I use a universal uh remote control, And you have to put in a number, I have a modern one. And the modern one you you uh you type uh search, And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off. And then you know, oh it it's the right one. We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one. That's uh when the circuit is closed, it produces the pattern. But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different. what you have to do is uh get these patterns right. What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern, this chip, uh is trying to switch off the television. And when it's uh switched off, you can push a button as uh it's working now, And then he saves that setting	He also stressed that the remote must be compatible with all television brands.
And um the the forty plus people, I already told you. Oh, this is a problem. Oh sorry about that. The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty. So it should be flashy or just more interesting. that's It changes things. I just I just didn't read it well. That kinda changes the whole situation. then we have to make some nice features. I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way, to make it more like a mobile phone. More modern.	The Project Manager corrected his target group announcement and announced that the target age group was actually ages 40 and below.
But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy. Spongy, like sponge. So rubber, kind of. Uh soft materials. But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea, because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. But I didn't knew uh knew what it means. it's also a stress-ball.	He also discussed the trend towards spongy materials.
It's very uh difficult to to to do it. Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control. that's the problem. That's the main problem. Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations. actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost. But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement. if we implement uh speech recognition, I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well. Since you have to uh configure speech thing. But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros. We have to decide on that. I got an email uh And it says uh the chip can be uh simple, regular or advanced. They say uh a display requires an advanced chip. And this is more expensive than all the other chips. And speech recognition? Yeah, probably too. I I haven't got anything about speech recognition,	The group discussed the cost of adding speech recognition, the LCD screen, and the advanced chip.
I just want to give you uh Mike again, the first uh presentation I received an email uh and uh I searched uh on this d document, recent investigation of the remote control market. It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe, Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. So it's very important for us to create something new. Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. Uh this uh aspect is the most important one. It uh is twice important as the following. The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative. Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features. And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion, because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition. But we already have the flashing flashing light Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use. We already discussed that. Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy. So I took uh that part of the webpage. And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy, yeah, uh have detected the following trends. This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us, maybe. But it's about uh clothes and shoes. But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy. Spongy, like sponge. So rubber, kind of. Uh soft materials. But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea, because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. But I didn't knew uh knew what it means. it's also a stress-ball. Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control, I	The Marketing Expert gave a trendwatching report.
Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. So it's very important for us to create something new. Uh this uh aspect is the most important one.	He found that a fancy look and feel was most important for users.
we're going to talk about the conceptual model. I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes, minute. we just talked about it looks. Has to look nice. Usability is very important. People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones. Um It has to be very basic, not too many buttons. Light switches on if you use a button. Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility. And it has to be easy to learn. And the functions are volume, channel to choose channels, an on-off, a mute uh button, and a text T_V_ button. That are the functions.	The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting.
Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board. That's for the next one.	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will draw the prototype design on the smartboard at the next meeting.
actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost. It's very uh difficult to to to do it. But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement. if we implement uh speech recognition, I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well. You mean uh these to the low? But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons, like one two three. Yeah, just th th th other buttons like text T_V_. Put that on the button bottom. m maybe we cho should put that on top, Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom, and and the switch channel in the middle. maybe you just have to make it uh That's not scrollable too easy. It doesn't make a difference, if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other. Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other, But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with uh channel changing. I think it will only look more like the old remote controls. but we could do a lot of, lot more curving. But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square. But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then? Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well, We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition. do we s keep that? it it would be would be a good feature feature.	The group had difficulties deciding on the placement of the buttons, the shape of the device, and whether or not to include speech recognition.
Like a very big scroll-wheel. but just not on the top, but uh on the side of it. I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted. maybe you just have to make it uh That's not scrollable too easy. Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom, and and the switch channel in the middle. It doesn't make a difference, if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other. I think uh zapping is the highest priority. Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other, But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with uh channel changing. So so if we use that, they will probably have a long learning uh time. we have to care that it r uh looks really new. Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control. 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside. but i i it should be round in in shape. If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo. You have to look at that image of the iPod. Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then? Maybe you can buy separate ones uh buy the product. You buy, you get one. And uh basic. y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger? you could put it like that, so top down. Do we have to design that w as well? The docking station? But th Yeah, that can be very simple. Least. But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well. But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. As long as	The group finalized the look of the product, and eventually decided to incorporate speech recognition and an advanced chip.
for volume. For volume, or a channel. here we have also side scrolls. The scroll wheels, that's cool. That's for the volume.	The group decided to use a scroll button for volume control.
We still want to have a recharger, don't we? Re recharger. Base station. uh just just batteries, rechargeable batteries. and and we can use the home station kind of thing. So the energy uh is the recharger. Just a normal battery.	The remote will include rechargeable batteries and will be used with a recharging stand.
Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel. Make it in in yellow or something. Just like the colours of Real Reaction.	It will be small and yellow, to use one of the colors of the Real Reaction logo.
It it could be like a Nokia, like plastic. With the hard hard buttons. So that should be hard plastic. we just make it plastic. just hard plastic? the case is just a plastic one.	The remote will feature plastic buttons and casing, rather than rubber.
the component design. I looked at uh some similar devices, and uh my own common knowledge. this was on the web site. If you aim at a young public, you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green, blue, red. So flashy kinda colours. Uh shapes should be curved, so round shapes. Not Nothing square-like. iPod is trendy. And it is well curved square. we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing. And um sports and gaming device style characteristics.	The Industrial Designer advised that flashy colors and rounded shapes be used.
Um the buttons. Normal rubber I think. Like normal ordinary buttons. Soft. It it could be like a Nokia, like plastic. With the hard hard buttons. I think uh rubber really has an odd look. The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls, uh the buttons are part of the uh the style, I think is part of the remote control itself. it don't come out of the on the background. it's it's all on one level. So that should be hard plastic. But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material. basic remote control from normal plastic, the rounds of it from softer s The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient. And back light L_E_D_s. but I think there are multiple colour LEDs. And in green colour, the back lights Just make it some different colours. Blue, red and green, or something.	They discussed materials for the buttons and the backlight.
But just in two D_, not in depth. more rounded. but i i it should be round in in shape. You have to look at that image of the iPod. But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square.	The remote will feature a double-curved, rounded square design.
we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control. the colours also. So we have ha to ma make it in black, black, yellow. Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black. because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy, to attract a young public. Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front. Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts, with all with the the logo on it? Can we do that? So Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue Still still transparent. Yeah. But with all with logo on it. But anyways uh it should be transparent. Just like a mobile phone, you can make um different fronts on it. Just give five with them, just in a box. Five different but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent.	The group discussed how to incorporate the logo and including changeable faces.
I don't think that's an opportunity.	The remote will not feature an LCD screen.
I had uh to make a sort of a design. I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls. So I did some searching on the internet. This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment. I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players. Mobile phones. just modern modern but still uh basic. Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller. 'Cause remote con control, you can see it here, you have to bo reach both out both sides. And here you just have one, few buttons. uh I definitely think we should go like this. And then changeable fonts, It's the most important part, I think. And the home base is something like that, something simple. and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit. Uh basic buttons. On-off, mute. And th maybe two others, I dunno. Text buttons. And then the colour buttons, if we want it on. I don't find it very usable, and then yeah we saw the the pla display, in the the iPod. They can put the basic buttons, one, two, three, four. And uh f above ten. That's on on the display. That th there is no display there. But it's on the place of the display. And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part. my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look. M_P_ three player. if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something, we I don't think we should put it on top then. I think that, if we're gonna put in more technology, that you need to be able to uh switch it open. if you put in uh speech recognition, you need so more uh many more buttons.	The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the interface with the group.
Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board. That's for the next one. But you definitely get a specific instruction. But th think about something that's more rounded. Yeah, five. Let's give five.	The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to draw the prototype at the next meeting, and the User Interface Designer was instructed to finalize the button placement.
Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well, Probably we need a uh advanced chip then. it it would be would be a good feature feature.	They eventually decided to incorporate speech recognition and an advanced chip.
So you don't see all the buttons you else need. But it sounds very difficult to use. Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it. So you can't use your thumb for it. here we have also side scrolls. I dunno if we can use that. Do we want to use for volume. For volume, or a channel. then we can even simplify it more. By just putting the volume on the side. And and just channel buttons here. The channel buttons are often used. And you can't use them now with your thumb, m maybe we cho should put that on top, and buttons we we don't use on, in the bottom. Yeah, just th th th other buttons like text T_V_. Put that on the button bottom. You mean uh these to the low? Except from the on-off button. But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons, like one two three. So maybe we can put that on the bottom. I think it's pretty standard, these rubber buttons on the top. I think it's modern to light this area up, and to light this area up. I think th the the top buttons are okay. They sh Those should be on top. But uh we we can switch those two,	They discussed the placement and design of the buttons and decided to use scroll wheels for volume.
But I think we have to make the case transparent, Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh Uh the battery contacts, like normal batteries ca you can put in. We still want to have a recharger, don't we? Re recharger. Base station. uh just just batteries, rechargeable batteries. and and we can use the home station kind of thing. It's just batteries, It's dark in the room. But you mostly use it indoors, Or we can also use solar cells. Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch. Um cases, flat, so uncurved. Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back. And three D_ curved is also in depth. Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls, we must use rubber buttons. So we can't use the flat buttons. Um these kinda materials can be used. we just make it plastic. And uh the L_C_D_. we need uh the expensive, most expensive chip, if we use an L_C_D_. I don't think that's an opportunity. Uh are are we using a a rubber case, Uh I don't think a rubber case looks The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh. fruit and veg can be just the covers. I can't imagine a soft remote control. Titanium, uh I think it's too expensive. just hard plastic? Not the sh the square form. you can make it curved or mm round. But just in two D_, not in depth. more rounded. So the energy uh is the recharger. We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these. What exactly. Just a normal battery. the case is just a plastic one. Yeah th yeah, the chip is the the regular one. And we need a plastic case, with a scroll wheel.	The group decided to use rechargeable batteries and a stand, to use plastic for the casing and buttons, and to not include an LCD screen.
Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then? Yeah, five. Let's give five.	The group decided to design five changeable faces for the device.
Yeah, we just made a Word file with the basic elements. Simply a square with uh round corners. Uh the material should be hard plastic. Uh colour changeable, and also transparent. The functions are just basic. Mute function, on-off function, text functions. And the logo is over here, and the mic. So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone? Yeah, speech recognition. Um I didn't have a specification of that. But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. Only one button to say it's on or off. Yes, you need options to configure it, and after that you don't need 'em anymore. Well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad. I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. So Um on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. Um the on-off button is a bit bigger, uh so it stands out. It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as I know. It's uh twelve buttons. F the form well, we've taken that from the iPod, other popular technical device. Um we'll use hard plastic. Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons, uh non-rubber buttons. We have decided uh in the the channel buttons, there's a little uh colour around it. And also in the num-pads, there's also colour light behind it.	The designers presented the prototype, which resembles an ipod in appearance, and is made of transparent coloured plastic.
Are we doing the the speech recognition? Okay, but it's still possible uh uh financially. Okay yeah. Well then then we're gonna put it in. Or are we making a slide open, like underneath? Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls. It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well. Yeah, we're gonna use the advanced chip then. No, you have a different chip for speech recognition. So So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget.	The group discussed speech recognition , whether the remote should slide open or fold open, and what type of chip they should use.
So these are the um last notes we I made. F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me. If anything doesn't look right, just say it to me then.	The project manager presented the agenda and the minutes from the previous meeting.
Okay, maybe we use this button for the Okay, there is one uh function I use uh daily, and it's not on the basic functions. It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart. Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something. Right, the video channel, Play Station, etcetera. That's used pretty often. So here are multiple speech buttons, I don't know how many. Uh menu buttons with arrows. Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs? Colour buttons. Yeah, maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel, that it is volume. There's one text button I prefer. That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page, uh like seven hundred, uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred, you will switch to your television and back to text. If you if you turn teletext on, you you set the seven hundred, and you turn it off, then the next time you turn it on, it still stays on seven hundred? That's a functionality for the television. uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred, page seven hundred to the television. Th th th if you switch it on.	The group discussed adding extra buttons/functions.
We have decided uh in the the channel buttons, there's a little uh colour around it. And also in the num-pads, there's also colour light behind it.	The number buttons have a back-light.
Um on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. Um the on-off button is a bit bigger, uh so it stands out. It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as I know. It's uh twelve buttons.	The remote has both buttons and a scroll wheel.
Digital pen is horrible. But if you want to download it to your computer, it's doesn't work. Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with, if it worked really well. Yeah, i if if it would be faster, it would be great. Yeah, the drawings are are hard to make, I think. Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. But you might as well do it in normal computer style.	The group had problems with the smart board and digital pens.
Uh colour changeable, and also transparent.	The colours will be changeable.
Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. I think that was the m biggest problem.	The group felt the information they got was not always useful, or was not given to them at the right time.
It's kind of weird that we we get this information now, afterwards. Like uh the prices. If we knew that before, we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker.	It was felt that the group should have received the information about costs before designing the prototype.
Well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad. And h how does the second level come out? Uh it slides uh along?	The designers had not included the slide-out second level in their drawing of the prototype.
Okay, let's have a look at this one here, the production cost of it. Yeah, there are some that they didn't mention, because recharge is not on the list. So I think we are pretty much in the right direction, because it's twelve point three Euros. But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or Can we make that for uh h twenty cents? The b the button supplements, I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was But this is expensive, the sample speaker. Is that uh included? In the twelve Euro or	The project manager went through the finances, and the total cost came to 12.3 euros, although this did not include the cost of the recharger, which was not on the price list.
So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone? Yeah, speech recognition. Um I didn't have a specification of that. But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. Only one button to say it's on or off. Yes, you need options to configure it, and after that you don't need 'em anymore. I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. So So here are multiple speech buttons, I don't know how many.	The group were unsure how many extra buttons would be needed for speech recognition.
Yeah, I made some criteria uh, so we can uh ev evaluate our model. and we have to test the criteria from one to zero. We sh we we we can give it uh a number, and then we can give ourself an average for our And um we have to discuss about, if we give it a one or a seven. If it's really uh, if you can if you can get the iPod look, then it's beautiful, I think. The basic colours are black or green or yellow? Maybe um company colours? A bit a bit of yellow. Yeah, grey. Just dark grey I think. Changeable fronts, so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful. Okay, just give it a two. The fancy look-and-feel. And we can change the colours, so that's uh really fancy I think. It's pretty cool. If you slide it open, it lights up. And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons, but behind the buttons. I think it's one. Learnable? Easy to use? Uh it's it's very easy to use, but uh the second layer is not easy to use. And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer. Because because I think I think the scroll wheel, uh it's very handy, but the first time you get this thing in your hands, it's not to use the scroll wheel. Then a two. New features. Techno technological innovative? And the scrollwheel, backlights, slide. The speech function is new. and the slide. Uh I think the slide is pretty new. But then we also have the the home station. We are forgetting about that now, but Yeah, we didn't draw that too, but Okay. And new features, so we give it a two or also again a one? No, just so it's still a two. Yeah, but did we reach, um with our uh style, the targeted audience? You get the fancy things for younger people. And you get the the aesthetic things for older people. But we didn't follow the latest trends. Yeah, you could make a	The prototype was evaluated and received an average overall score of 1.8.
It's uh twelve buttons. It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as I know.	The remote will include buttons and a scroll wheel.
I think just I just write a final report. Fill in the questionnaire.	The group have to fill out a final questionnaire.
Uh the material should be hard plastic. Uh colour changeable, and also transparent.	The remote will be made of hard, transparent coloured plastic, and will come in different colours.
So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together. Was there room for creativity? Mm uh i Yeah, I think so. Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it. So Okay, so the leadership Just normal discussion, I think. Not one leader or something. Uh team work the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard. We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with. Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. I think that was the m biggest problem. Like uh the prices. If we knew that before, we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker. But the teamwork was okay. Yeah, uh everybody could speak their uh opinion. I think uh everyone listen to each other. The smart board is okay. Digital pen is horrible. But if you want to download it to your computer, it's doesn't work. Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with, if it worked really well. Yeah, i if if it would be faster, it would be great. Yeah, the drawings are are hard to make, I think. Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. But you might as well do it in normal computer style. New ideas found. I don't know what it mean. To gather, or to uh work together, uh or new ideas for Yeah, but still, you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this. Because we don't have any sizes and Yeah, but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time, I think. Yeah, this this is just the idea phase,	The group evaluated the project process, and were generally pleased with their creativity and teamwork, but were unsatisfied with the equipment.
maybe a a minimalist design, the least uh possible amount uh of buttons. But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it. you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons, but on the other hand they need many buttons	Creating a remote with a minimal number of buttons yet having lots of functions available on the remote.
but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control. It's impossible. Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext, and on the other side uh just n uh regular television. Uh Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television. always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code.	How to accommodate different television models with one remote.
And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max.	The production cost will be 12.50 Euro maximum.
it's time uh for some discussion. What's your experience with remote control? I always lose them. A lot of buttons which you don't use Not user friendly. Black, all black. maybe we should try to make it fun. You had different remote controls for different devices. perhaps you can integrate them or something. but then again you you still have a lot of buttons, there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in Dutch. Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly. maybe a a minimalist design, the least uh possible amount uh of buttons. But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it. Because uh things for uh teletext, I dunno uh, w you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons, but on the other hand they need many buttons Because I think a market will be all kind of people. Elderly p el elderly, young people, so. I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain, yeah. I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control, they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television. but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control. It's impossible. Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext, and on the other side uh just n uh regular television. Uh Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television. always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code.	The team then discussed their experiences with remotes and various features to consider when producing a remote.
Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification.	The marketing expert will look at user requirement specifications.
the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design,	The industrial designer will look at the working design.
The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design.	The user interface designer will look at the technical functions design
I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting. Um I'm the Project Manager of this project, This is uh the agenda for our first meeting. I will hope we will get acquainted to each other. We'll do a little tool training with these two things. We'll take a look at the project plan. Uh there will be time for discussion. Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table. Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face. and there are microphones here also. and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project. and my uh function is User Interface Design, I think. uh I'm the Industrial Designer I'm uh Marketing Expert. My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers.	The project manager acquainted the team with the tools and equipment around them and then had the team members introduce themselves by name and what role they had in the project.
I said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original, trendy and of course, user friendly. It consists of three phases, namely the functional design, conceptual design and detailed design. As you can see, all of these phases consists of two parts, namely individual work part and a meeting But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here. They are smart boards. As you can see, you can give a presentation on them. And uh this one here is a white board. Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room. As you can see, this is the same tool bar uh as is located here. Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page, um uh to go back and forward between pages, Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board, for instance Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want. it's not such a fast board, and of course you can also, when you click here, uh erase things, And um you can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that. because we want to save all the results. And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen,	The project manager then introduced the upcoming project along with more tools and equipment to the team members.
Um that's what you will need for our first exercise, because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal. to do it on a blank sheet, with different colours and also with different pen widths Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word. Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing, eh. it could be a turtle, or a snail, It's a giraffe. it can reach everything. And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project. Could you write the words, uh underneath it? I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence. You can try out the eraser now.	The team members then participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals.
Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros. And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market. And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max.	After the drawing exercise, the project manager talked about the project finances and production costs.
Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting. I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary, which means I will make uh minutes Um if I'm right, there are three presentations, And um we will also take a look at new project requirements, um if you haven't heard about them yet. Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation. I'll go first. Okay. I'll go first yeah. I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control. Uh when you press a button, uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume, um a little connection is made on a little print plate Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set. Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls, are that uh they are very easy to produce, uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production Uh and the technology's already available, Uh I made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works. the sub-component, I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is, is f in this example it's the button. Uh when it is pressed down, um, the switch is ter is uh is switched on, so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course, Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control. Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held, Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours, and uh easy to use buttons. Perhaps soft touch, uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly	The project manager opened the meeting and then the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote along with his personal preferences for the appearance of a remote.
So we don't have to make it very small, like uh like a mobile phone or something, so the buttons sh should be that small, or shouldn't be that complex because we have the L_C_D_ screen, we have the various options. So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen, you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use. but an L_C_D_ screen, the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot. so those they those have to h be find very easily. but like I said, L_C_D_ screen is easily to use And it should be easy to use. Especially the volume buttons, the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels.	The marketing expert indicated that an ideal remote would include an LCD screen, would not be too small in size, and is easy to use.
we're going for an L_C_D_ screen? I think it's the most easier thing, But for now it's L_C_D_. Okay.	The remote will feature an LCD screen.
I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements? then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet. So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext. Uh the remote control should only be used for the television, otherwise the project becomes more complex, Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus, and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty, And uh a last point, but also very important, our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products, which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design. according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions. you said it should only uh work with one appliance? Yeah. Only be used for television. Then it should have uh on, off, Standby options, the basics then by a volume, channel, one till two zero numbers on it, A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers. because some T_V_s, if you press the t one and then the two, it be between five secs it make twelve, I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that, and that's that's not relaxed But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty, Uh younger people have now, sixteen till to twenty five age, are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen. But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap. A touch screen uh probably uh even more. perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen. you don't know how much it costs, the L_C_D_ screen. I don't	The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion in which the team discussed their target group and made decisions on the appearance and functions of their upcoming product.
perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen. A mute button. The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection, volume con selection, and power s power usage. And other other less important things are screen settings, audio settings, and channel settings, I've written down an an on or off button, volume selection, channel selection, uh the digits from one to zero, huh. Um or from zero to nine. Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits, mute button, a separate menu for teletext, a battery indicator. we could also implement a audio settings, screen settings and channel settings, but as sub-menus. Channel settings.	The remote will have buttons within the LCD display for power, volume selection, channel selection, digits from zero to nine, mute, a menu for teletext, a battery indicator, to access double digits, screen settings, channel settings, and audio settings.
and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote. Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls, of how they uh they look, and information from the web that I found. Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set, adjust volume, that kind of thing. There are some uh examples of remote controls. You can see they are very different. The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera. And the other is uh more user friendly, little with big buttons. Um I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach, A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that. personal preferences is is uh a simple remote, with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use. And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance. If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video, it could also work with uh with the stereo, you could reuse the buttons And it should be a user friendly, clear buttons, and not too much.	The user interface designer discussed the technical functions of a remote and indicated that a user centered approach to designing the interface would be preferable.
And uh a last point, but also very important, our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products, which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design.	The corporate image must be recognizable in the product.
We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote, that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control, The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more. Younger people, from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens, speech recognition e etcetera. And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age. The elderly people, from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features, and we possess less than two third, that's two fifth, of the market share in that area. Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often. Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly, and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot, Remote control has to have to have a low power usage, because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour, The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control, so those they those have to h be find very easily. Buttons. Like what all colleagues said, have to have to be minimalized. or in L_C_D_ screen. but an L_C_D_ screen, the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot. So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen, you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use. because we have the L_C_D_ screen, we have the various options. so the buttons sh should be that small, So we don't have to make it very small, like uh like a mobile phone or something, The last but not least, younger people are more critical about the features. And the older people spend more money, and easily on a remote control. Because they use the remote control often	The marketing expert discussed the functional requirements of a remote and user tendencies in using remotes.
Uh the remote control should only be used for the television, otherwise the project becomes more complex,	The remote will only be used for televisions.
And maybe a low battery indicator? On the screen.	The LCD screen will have a low battery indicator.
and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty,	The product needs to reach a new market with customers under forty.
And go to standby mode when you don't use it,	The remote will go into standby when idle.
so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down, the remote shuts down.	The remote will shut down when the television shuts down.
Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet. So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext.	The team will not pay any attention to teletext.
and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext. so not too much teletext support, but in a separate menu,	The LCD screen will have a separate menu for teletext.
so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen, And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons	The remote will allow users to have the possibility to enlarge the buttons.
But would it be useful to imple implement both? Yeah, if the costs al allow it. it should be done. If it could be done, should be done. so we only do this when we have enough money left.	The remote will be capable of speech recognition if there is enough money left in the team's budget.
of put it in a recharger. Charger. So we are going for the for the recharger.	The remote will have a rechargeable battery which comes with a charger.
but also on the older, and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen? but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger.	If consumers over forty will want a remote with an LCD screen.
But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap. A touch screen uh probably uh even more. you don't know how much it costs, the L_C_D_ screen. I don't have any costs here, if it costs gets too much, too expensive, then yeah, we should be sticking to rubber buttons. I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens. if you uh you receive an email about that, uh can you post it in the	How much an LCD screen costs.
So we don't have any normal buttons I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control. So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote. No buttons at all.	The remote will be button-less.
But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_. just a cable, or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on. Something like that,	Where consumers will place the charger.
uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television,	What to do if people forget to recharge the batteries in their remote.
power supply is one of the most important things. Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off. If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno.	What sort of power supply to use since the LCD screen requires a large amount of power.
And a teletext, but that is not of the question. But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it? and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext.	Whether to include buttons for teletext.
Maybe only the on and o on and off button. But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said, uh normal on and off button for the T_V_, But a not as normal button, in the L_C_D_, maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_, There has to be a on button on the remote, No you just tap I think. because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode, it should pop on. I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen, you first have to search where is the on button, But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote, then you do the on, I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control.	Whether the remote should feature a regular power button or if the power button should be integrated with the LCD display.
And you said something about speech recognition? also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five, twenty six to thirty five years, seventy six percent, and thirty six to forty five, thirty five percent. twelve fifty, twelve fifty. I know let's do a speech. But they want to talk into the remo remote control, or something, I think an L_C_D_ screen should be suf sufficient. But when you look at the percentages but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh. I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen, But would it be useful to imple implement both? Yeah, if the costs al allow it. but how would you like to implement that, that you say volume up, and then it goes up, Certain systems already exist, I think. Then you also have to have different languages if we go international. so we only do this when we have enough money left.	Whether to implement speech recognition.
I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_. Yeah, it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen. Mm, I don't I dunno I don't think that's you need some kind of C_P_U_, I guess. but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume. So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen.	Whether the remote requires a CPU.
Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries We already decided that on the previous meeting. which you can recharge through the docking station. if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can uh change them. but it should be th I think normal batteries, normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop. Yeah.	What sort of batteries to use.
And we won't include a a pen, or something to point, we we want to do it with our fingers, Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use Yeah o yeah, if they think it's handy to use a pen.	Whether to include a pen to use with the touchscreen on the remote.
So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber, or soft rubber. Or something something between that. Soft rubber. like like like a a eraser or something. That's the bit you can press it in, Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in. but but a hard rubber like this? Or softer rubber Uh hard rubber I think.	Whether to use hard or soft rubber.
Perhaps you could find something in the middle. round corners, but s but square, yeah. But maybe then both groups won't buy it. So it's a bit square, but it's also a bit uh round. So we should first decide about shape, I think. but I think it should be larger. Looks a bit like a Game Boy now. the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes? I think it's more round than square. But I think it should be a bit longer, perhaps.	What shape the remote should be.
Uh the batteries, uh we also thought about that already, uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop. Yeah. Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries We already decided that on the previous meeting. which you can recharge through the docking station.	The remote will use rechargeable batteries which recharge in a docking station.
So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down, And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television, you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen.	The remote will have a scrolling device.
And we won't include a a pen, or something to point,	The remote will not include a pen.
we wanted to make it from rubber Uh got a single curved uh rubber	The case will be made of rubber.
and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board,	The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board
maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision. So we can discuss these points. those points um energy question mark. are we going to do it with separate docking station Uh chip on print and case. I think energy were batteries The docking station. Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries We already decided that on the previous meeting. which you can recharge through the docking station. if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can uh change them. but it should be th I think normal batteries, normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop. Yeah. Um what was with the chip on print? Chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen? You still have a print plate. I dunno what w what we have to decide about that. chip on print, I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got, uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button. But when you got a L_C_D_ screen, with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place, but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate, you need some kind of C_P_U_, I guess. Mm, I don't I dunno I don't think that's Yeah, it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen. I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_. but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume. So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen. there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think what we should also have on, I just remembered, um a menu to go back through the first uh if if	The team then made decisions regarding energy sources, components, and the remote interface.
and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve? I thought that was a quite good Uh got a single curved uh rubber	The case will be single curved.
what's the standard colour? we have different colour. You should you should have a black one because uh I think black is standard. Dark grey, something like this this colour or something. I think it's better to have silver nowadays. Yeah the the silver black are our main colours. Yeah. w what about a yellow thing, it'll be a banana yellow, we have. Green, wood, brown. But if you use uh silver, uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy. I would think about colours like uh red, yellow, green, blue, The fruity colours and the autumn colours, like red and brown, dark red and brown. And and do we have to have a normal black one, or uh	Color of remote.
Because we decided to have two kind of remotes, two designs, or was it two colours? We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes. I think like my colleague, you said, is that's e better, or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something, with round squares. You could you could uh change the colours, that was also the idea. I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh Changing just the shape of the uh remote control? Perhaps you could find something in the middle. round corners, but s but square, yeah. But maybe then both groups won't buy it. and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small. Um. w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like but I think it should be larger. Yeah, three quarters. Larger I think. Looks a bit like a Game Boy now. So it's a bit square, but it's also a bit uh round. Uh Look something like that. Autumn colours like red, brown. So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour. between the young people? Fresh, exciting. And the old people, old and boring. like I said, young people like more soft materials and spongy ones So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber, or soft rubber. Or something something between that. Soft rubber. like like like a a eraser or something. That's the bit you can press it in, Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in. So we should first decide about shape, I think. but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself, uh you'll you'll always get some You always touch it, because you have how much? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen. Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time. And we won't include a a pen, or something to point, we we want to do it with our fingers, Because if you lose the	The team discussed case shapes, color options, types of rubber, and dimensions.
but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate, Chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a	The remote will use a chip on print.
But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something. you can make a very sensitive microphone, maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh But that's not import I think that's not im very important You could p you could put it in a logo of the company. between the round of the R_. because a microphone is very small thing, but you can make it look like it's big	Position of a microphone on the remote.
The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy. The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative, like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative And the third thing is it should be easy to use. I think with only one menu, four button, channel, volume, it should also be enough for easy to use. The personal preferences for the young people, they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow, uh strawberry red and stuff. The round shapes, and soft material m materials like the rubber. It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things. Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown, red, deep reds and stuff. They liked square shapes with round edges. And hard materials like wood, um titanium. And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like It's it's a bit like a banana. And for the elderly people just plain old.	The trend-watching reports indicated that products should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, in fruity colors, in soft and spongy materials, and in hard materials in autumn colors with square shapes with round edges if appealing to elderly people.
The other buttons and on here the top. I think it's it's easier to have it something like Oh a button uh minus here, plus over here. A minus here, plus over here. If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter. Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal? I think I would put a plus and a min uh here. And then the P_ in the mid in the middle But I'm going to look if I've got some examples We'll leave that to the usability engineering then. So not how much n not how often it's used, but W what's what's usual or normal. because I have two televisions at home. One is horizontal, one is vertical, it does it doesn't really matter, I think we have we don't have to decide about that now	Position of buttons.
I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching. The trends from the past years, what the people like, what the youngsters like, what the elderly people liked about shapes, colours, material and stuff. The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy. The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative, like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative And the third thing is it should be easy to use. I think with only one menu, four button, channel, volume, it should also be enough for easy to use. The personal preferences for the young people, they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow, uh strawberry red and stuff. The round shapes, and soft material m materials like the rubber. It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things. Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown, red, deep reds and stuff. They liked square shapes with round edges. And hard materials like wood, um titanium. And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like It's it's a bit like a banana. And for the elderly people just plain old. I think like my colleague, you said, is that's e better, or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something, with round squares.	The marketing expert discussed the results of trend-watching reports and his preference for a banana-like remote for younger people and a traditional remote for older people.
uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station I thought a little bit about the interface. Uh how it should look. And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons, but only an L_C_D_ screen, Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition. And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you. And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker. This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that Um perhaps it's useful, perhaps for because people um lose the remote, they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something. And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like And perhaps we could uh implement that. I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw. I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume. and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon. I think it's not really on scale and and so forth. Um an options button. It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing. Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should, so that it's better in your hand or something uh. But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that. Uh and then uh if you press the op options button, now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings. And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of	The user interface designer discussed how speech recognition could be useful to users who often lose their remotes, the layout of the interface, and the option to include a scroll device on the side of the remote to access a menu containing extra features.
welcome everyone to our next meeting. but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side. Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting, which is hereby opened. Um today we once again have uh three presentations, if I'm right, and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts. Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes I'd say let's start with the first presentation. Um in the same order as last time? Components design, first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed. Uh first of all, the case, the case, the surrounding of the of the the remote control. the case was is made from rubber, I suppose. because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control the uh titanium was also an option. But uh it's a very expensive material. Uh rubber is, I think, uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber. Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it Um I h I had an idea single covered uh curved, sorry, single curved. it's t two dimensional. I think it's uh it's best to draw I thought of an idea like this. So it also looks nice when it's on your table. uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table, but it's c it's stands. Um the graphical user interface and the buttons, uh we also thought about that already. Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen, And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright. uh this should uh be uh our uh button component. Uh the batteries, uh we	After the project manager opened the meeting, the industrial designer discussed his preference for making a remote which is single-curved, made of rubber, contains an LCD, has a docking station to recharge the batteries, and uses a simple chip.
I think it will, No, I don't think very true because the colours. I think it's a three. because w we designed it for young people especially, Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing. n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that, I think they like the speech. L_C_D_ screen and scroll. you have all buttons on it which you'd like, microphone extra, L_C_D_ screen extra, scroll thing extra.	Whether the remote appeals to younger people.
then it's possible to make. You lose this one, you got eleven point five Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped.	The remote will not feature a scroll wheel.
Big microphone. just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible. perhaps you should make it a bit big, so people know it's there The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button.	Size of microphone.
It has relatively few features, those are features. the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature. The microphone is a feature. No, aren't the features and that you can change the channel's feature,	Whether LCD screens and microphones are components or features.
We could lose the curve. Nah. And I think we should lose the curve. then it will won't uh stand up from the table. And then you can keep the curve.	Whether to lose the curvature in the design of the remote case.
because uh I have to write the final report now.	The project manager will create a final report
A battery. One battery,	The remote uses a conventional battery.
I think we should scrap the sample speaker. Scrap sample speaker? you should you should drop the speech recognition. But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker.	Whether to keep the speech recognition component.
I think we also have to go to our own rooms again,	The team members will go to their own rooms.
It uh oh it's in the background. Oh. it would be uh something like this from the side, but with a bit of uh curve here, Single nee single curved. And then you can keep the curve.	The case will be single curved.
Eighteen and a half, We have to lower it with six points. We could lose the curve. Nah. We could lose the scroll wheel. You could make it just a regular scroll wheel. if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button. Normal scroll wheel. And I think we should lose the curve. I think we should scrap the sample speaker. then it will won't uh stand up from the table. Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something? otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen. Scrap sample speaker? you should you should drop the speech recognition. And then you can keep the curve. Or make it on a hand dynamo, but I don't think that will work. Ma make it with wood instead of rubber? We could make it titanium instead of rubber. What is special colour? Is that the wood uh wood uh I think it is. But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker. Th then we still have too much three. Point three. Let's make it thirteen or fourteen. That's a scroll wheel. Don't make it wood. we can make it brown, dark brown, not wood. a all kind of colours? special colours, fruity colours. but it's a special colour than just rubber colour. You have to add something to the rubber to make it green. then we have to scrap everything we got If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen then it's possible to make. How d uh uh how many colours? but we we we are we have yellow, red, uh black, titanium. But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour, but we're gonna make it yellow uh red, and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now. I then I think I p	The team had difficulty in meeting the the target cost and had to eliminate some of the more expensive components they had hoped to include in their design.
That's a scroll wheel. If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen then it's possible to make. You lose this one, you got eleven point five	Whether to lose the scroll wheel.
the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group, but I am willing to try it. Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that. Um and we're going to calculate the production costs, and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty, we're good, and if they're not we're going to uh re-design, but we have to do that uh very very quick I think, Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet. The microphone. Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in, so that I can also uh take minutes, uh count uh number of functions, because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots, so or different different screens, A battery. One battery, advanced chip, we have sample speaker. we already on nine. Single nee single curved. Rubber. No, we don't have push button. but with special colour we have. A special form, We don't got the button supplements. Eighteen and a half, We have to lower it with six points.	The project manager then led the team in calculating the production costs of their remote.
Rubber.	The case is made of rubber.
a all kind of colours? special colours, fruity colours. but it's a special colour than just rubber colour. You have to add something to the rubber to make it green. How d uh uh how many colours? but we we we are we have yellow, red, uh black, titanium. But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour, but we're gonna make it yellow uh red, and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now.	What colors to make the remote in.
Scrap sample speaker? you should you should drop the speech recognition. But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker. we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker.	The remote will not use a sample speaker and feature speech recognition.
Deadlines were sometimes very short. Bu but stressful. You think, no, my presentation isn't ready. so some some things I had in my presentation, they already told, and you had information I also had, you had information I didn't have But the technology was uh fantastic. Yeah, the technology's okay. I I don't really like the board, but sometimes it doesn't erase perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there. you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful but it doesn't really work all the time. Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below. so it's maybe a bit unnatural also. The project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have, you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation. So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations and what about uh this digital pen? I didn't use it at all. it's quite handy I think. it did work pretty well. it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer. It's b bi little bit too big to write. The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema You just sit there for ten minutes. At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment, No, I I never got that. I got like one email after ten minutes or something. I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think, sometimes, and I never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control. And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here, but after all we can say uh we are satisfied, but it it could've	The team found the project stressful, the equipment useful, the information available to them lacking, and their laptops to be slow and heavy.
advanced chip,	The remote will use an advanced chip.
Ma make it with wood instead of rubber? Don't make it wood. we can make it brown, dark brown, not wood. a all kind of colours?	Whether to make a remote out of wood or to make a remote with different colors.
And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time. Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation. what did you think about uh the process? How satisfied are we? Deadlines were sometimes very short. Bu but stressful. You think, no, my presentation isn't ready. I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together. Now we worked through each other, you had information I didn't have and you had information I also had, so some some things I had in my presentation, they already told, I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project. So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work. or maybe session of five minutes together or something, but but why not work here together, for example? Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms? probably to simulate the whole working uh process, like she told. Then you can work together too by mail or by, I dunno, chat, something, But the technology was uh fantastic. Yeah, the technology's okay. I I don't really like the board, but sometimes it doesn't erase perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there. you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful but it doesn't really work all the time. Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below. so it's maybe a bit unnatural also. The project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have, you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation. So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations and what about uh this digital pen? I didn't use it at all. it's quite handy I think. it did work pretty well. it is	The project manager then led the team in an evaluation of the project process.
welcome everyone. Um as you may have noticed I uh created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder. I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder, save in the folder. Save as project. Um I'm still going to take some minutes, and if I'm right, you two are going to give a prototype presentation? And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria? And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice, the finance uh aspect, whether we can afford what we have designed, and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation, This is about the total remote control. We made it green. there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype. And uh the screen light blue. this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under. And the R_ and R_ logo, Big microphone. just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible. perhaps you should make it a bit big, so people know it's there The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button. we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work. You push the scroll button and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available. For example uh T_V_ settings, uh remote settings, et cetera. So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button, it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu, uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button, and the opportunity to use the teletext, and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu, but in uh Yes. In an apart uh Perhaps we	The project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented their prototype for the remote which featured an LCD screen, a scroll button, and a battery indicator.
it's looks fancy, especially with the green colour. And the the curves which we decided, Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting? It uh oh it's in the background. Oh. it would be uh something like this from the side, but with a bit of uh curve here, it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom. Uh make it uh rather thick on the top, because uh on the top it has uh the screen, Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top? I think yeah, the battery should be in here, fancy enough means, does it comes to the younger people and the elder people. I if you don't make it green, then the elder people won't won't like it. all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now, I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also. Alright, it's a one. Oh it's a one. Yeah, I think two. It's very fancy, I think. I think it is, because it has an L_C_D_ screen, a mi microphone. And uh uh the scroll is rubber, Also huh uh-huh the buttons, are they easy to find? Yeah, because they're right on your screen. The options are it uh little bit harder, It's easier than the regular uh remote control. I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button. So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most A two, okay, I personally think, because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use, I I think if you have the button at the right, I don't think you can find the option button that easy. but you have y then you have here s written option on here, the teletext button	The team found the remote to be fancy, innovative, fairly easy to use, available in different colors, fairly spongy, difficult to misplace, and targeted to younger people.
my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users. Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven, from true to false, like question, is remote big enough, we can say it's true or it's false by steps. One means absolutely not true, seven means true. is the remote control fancy enough, is it in innovative enough, and is it easy enough to use. Is the design fancy enough? it's looks fancy, especially with the green colour. And the the curves which we decided, Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting? It uh oh it's in the background. Oh. it would be uh something like this from the side, but with a bit of uh curve here, it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom. Uh make it uh rather thick on the top, because uh on the top it has uh the screen, Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top? I think yeah, the battery should be in here, fancy enough means, does it comes to the younger people and the elder people. I if you don't make it green, then the elder people won't won't like it. all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now, I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also. Alright, it's a one. Oh it's a one. Yeah, I think two. It's very fancy, I think. I think it is, because it has an L_C_D_ screen, a mi microphone. And uh uh the scroll is rubber, Also huh uh-huh the buttons, are they easy to find? Yeah, because they're right on your screen. The options are it uh little bit harder, It's easier than the regular uh remote control. I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest	The marketing expert conducted a project evaluation of the prototype.
And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements. Um therefore we have to to do some internet search. For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support, and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions?	The marketing expert will come up with user requirements by doing internet research.
this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design. Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design, etcetera etcetera.	The industrial designer should produce a working design.
And it seems you get more information by email.	They will receive more information by email
Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros. Uh	The product will be sold at 25 Euros.
the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros.	The aim is to seel 50 million Euros.
And the production cost should be the half of the selling price.	The production cost should be half the selling price.
I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them. but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video. And um reserve the possibility to add other features.	To get started they will assume the remote to be for TV and video, and reserve the possibility to add features.
Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard. Um uh we should take some practice. I have some instructions now to do that. you know how to the documents work. Uh this for toolbar. You see it next. Um And we can use this pen to perform. It doesn't always work. and in the format menu you can select colour and line width, etcetera etcetera. Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal. Uh you should explain Uh with different colours and with different pen widths. And you should explain why you draw that particular animal. Different pen widths, how do you do that? Uh with the format menu. And use different colours etcetera. It's a giraffe. Yeah. Can you use one blank sheet per drawing? Or so y you must save it at the end you can press the next button, I in the file option menu. Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other? introduction and get acquainted I'm guessing a turtle. How to select the next or Colours were under format A fox yeah. It's a cat.	The group practices using the smart board by choosing an animal to draw and then explaining why they picked it.
let's get started. Uh opening acquaintance, tool training, uh how to use the things here. Uh project plan discussion, and yeah then the rest of the meeting. Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control, that's both original, trendy and user-friendly. Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom. Uh functional design, then we do some in individual work, then we have a meeting to discuss the results, etcetera etcetera. And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up.	When the meeting begins the project manager lists the agenda and then describes the project, which is to develop a new remote control that is original, trendy, and user-friendly.
and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to. Let's see what we got to do.	They close the meeting upon establishing what each person will do.
I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them. like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there, which I know, there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices. So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video. And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre, but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function. And you you don't need that for a T_V_. And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well, so I kind of need to know what we uh need. and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting. We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video. And um reserve the possibility to add other features. So we have a basic starting point so make sure it's extendible. Yeah. and you can always extend that it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly. Th the least amount of functions possible	They decide to first assume it is only for TV and video, but allowing the possibility to add more features.
Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions.	The interface designer should specify technical functions.
we each have a specific task, I didn't know if you received the same mail. as I saw in my mail. this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design. Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions. And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements. Uh did any of you already do some work on this part I started making an overview for myself, um what I had to do, and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever. 'cause we have three design steps Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do? from a marketing uh perspective, um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements. Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled? there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market. I mean, what functions do they have. Um especially what are their shortcomings? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product? Um therefore we have to to do some internet search. For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support, and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions? Um and we can interview current users and future users. What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control? Um especially for future users, uh I'm thinking of early adopters, because they they use new technology first, Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are? No n not specifically.	They each identify their individual tasks during each phase based on their role in the group.
we have a financial aspect to this project. Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros. Uh the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros. Uh that's quite a big amount of money. And the production cost should be the half of the selling price. now it's time for some discussion. Uh I'm taking notes. Um	The project manager goes over the product budget and they proceed to have discussion.
Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design, etcetera etcetera. I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session? Do we only have to to do uh phase one, the functional design uh? After that we are going to the conceptual uh we have meeting, individual work, meeting. And at the end of the day we have a final meeting. I mean, is it gonna be a multimedia control centre? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it? I think that is the user requirements part. As to what they want. Uh do they want all those functions on that small But but we need good communication about this stuff, So if I don't know what components to put in, it's kind of hard.	The team again discusses their individual responsibilities and move on to ponder whether the remote will be multifunctional or only for the TV.
And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far? I started I started with the first phase, I had to focus on the working design, which you said. I basically had two points. Uh according to the coffee uh machine example, I have batteries to supply energy, and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_. I got another point. It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo. Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function. And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume. That are the the basic options for a remote control. I mean, you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also. I got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user-friendly. Uh really easy to use buttons, not not uh very small buttons, but not the the also the big big buttons, It has to be a small unit. you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house. Uh and a and a good uh zapping range. Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be, uh yeah um yeah, quite a big distance. I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment. I think we can go ahead with what we have. I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder.	They briefly discuss characteristics of a desirable remote, including medium size buttons, small unit, and work within a good zapping range.
Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions, if you know what I mean. The the simple functions for for the the whole public, and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh Uh you can make a if you make a drawing. Basic. so it should fit right in into your hand. Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand, and the screen is below, and the buttons are in the middle. But it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top, And for the speech uh recognition part, if we want to incorporate that, we need a microphone. Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me. So we put this on top, and then make the corporate logo I mean this is basically numbers, volume, uh channel up and down. Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right? So channel programming? Yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. Screen settings, brightness and colour. S swap channels? Swap's good option. That's very good idea. Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up. The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is, sorry, uh is uh if you're pressing up and down, you can easily press the okay once you, when you're not already at your choice. So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button. Yeah okay. So on the on the top is better. Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone, but I think that's okay.	The group discussed what functions to include and the layout of the remote, and the marketing expert drew a possible design on the board.
But it also needs to have corporate identity. so the the logo has to be uh present yeah, and the colours as well. And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control.	The remote will feature the corporate logo and colour.
I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display. Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things. you have basically a button menu, which you can use directly, uh according to the old principle. And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options, thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah. Yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. Screen settings, brightness and colour.	They decided to have buttons for the basic functions and make the advanced functions accessible through the screen.
I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need. This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky. Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information. So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls. And well the info on the website which came too late. But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow, so I was trying to organise them for myself.	The industrial designer did not receive the necessary information in time to prepare his presentation according to instructions, so his presentation was based on his own ideas.
The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the	The user interface designer will work on the layout of the remote and the LCD screen menu.
Hey what's wrong with my computer? I think you have to uh change your desktop uh Yeah my computer is not functioning properly. Did you plug in the power cable when you come back? You pressed alt F_ four? No no no. I pressed the mouse button.	Some people had problems using the computers.
I'm gonna talk about functional requirements. Well uh some research has be done uh has been done. Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control. Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire. They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls. Users think they're ugly. they are often lost somewhere in the room. Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. And they're bad for R_S_I_. Um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users.	The marketing expert reported on research which shows that users think most remotes are ugly, easily lost and bad for RSI.
and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes.	The project manager will write up the meeting minutes.
Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings, mono, stereo, uh pitch, bass. Uh most relevant, uh most used functions, Uh power button, uh channel, volume selection. Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash, and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future.	Audio settings are rarely used, and the power, channel and volume buttons are used most often.
And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen.	The remote will have an LCD screen and speech recognition.
Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible. And I think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups, uh nice design, which uh does not make the remote control in your room.	The remote should be user-friendly and have a good look and feel.
Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department.	The industrial designer will work on the functional aspects of the remote.
Okay. So he's layout and you're function. Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part? I think that's a that's a good separation. Yeah we have to kind of work together.	There was some confusion about the the roles of the user interface designer and the industrial designer.
By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from? I receiv the mail but you don't. So No so it's a text file n in the project folder. And the new product should reach new markets, which is the customers below forty. But it also needs to have corporate identity. so the the logo has to be uh present yeah, and the colours as well. Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device, only your television.	The marketing expert and project manager described the new requirements that the target group is users under 40, the remote should not include teletext, should be only for TV, and should feature the corporate logo.
And the new product should reach new markets, which is the customers below forty. Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty, the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen. Uh sixteen to forty.	The target group will be aged 16-40.
I uh had uh two examples. Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons. This the easy one I think we have to to combine them. And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples. Okay so so we have the option for more functions. Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah. We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button. Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed. so maybe you can hide them or something. So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen, uh with a clear menu. So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable	The user interface designer showed examples of two contrasting remotes, recommending that they should use the best features of both.
Yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. Screen settings, brightness and colour. Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen. And then with these buttons, woa, y you navigate.	The advanced functions such as audio settings, contrast and channel programming will be accessed through the screen.
And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech So what does the screen do? For for the advanced functions I think. Well I, my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions.	The group decided to use an LCD screen and speech recognition.
Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device, only your television. for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext, only for T_V_.	The remote will be for TV only.
but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash, and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future. for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext, only for T_V_.	A teletext option will not be included.
Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky. Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information. So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls. And well the info on the website which came too late. But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow, so I was trying to organise them for myself. I mean everything speaks for itself I guess. Mean you press a button um the it tru goes, it sends a signal to a chip, which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies. and the T_V_ will translate it into a function.	The industrial designer described how a remote works, and explained that his presentation was incomplete because he had not received the necessary information in time.
I thought but this is really your department, that we need just the functional display and four cursors. most of the time you have one button in the middle. It says menu, and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level.	They also discussed what buttons would be needed to navigate the menu on the LCD screen.
Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up. That's very good idea.	There will be LEDs under the buttons so that buttons in use will light up.
So we put this on top, and then make the corporate logo Yeah okay. So on the on the top is better.	The screen and microphone will be at the top of the remote.
So we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy.	The remote will use kinetic energy.
You will do the evaluation. You probably get a mail. Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow.	The marketing expert will prepare the prototype evaluation.
but uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard. Next thirty minutes to design something so So we're gonna work here? On this sketchboard?	The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on the prototype design.
most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel. Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel. And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative. I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition, And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use. Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect. I first uh chose for the battery, 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious, easiest choice to go to. But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy,	For users, the three most important aspects of a remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, and ease of use.
Advanced chip. Okay.	The remote will use an advanced chip.
So welcome to the marketing presentation once again. Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public, because that's our public. fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing, uh shoes and furniture. And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey. oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours. most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel. Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel. And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative. I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition, And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use. Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect. Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing, and and some fruit and colours Just made a quick design.	The marketing expert talked about trendwatching and explained that the current trends are for fruit and vegetable themed products and products with a spongy texture.
Uh the case would be doubly curved. So Rubber material.	The case will be double-curved and made of rubber.
I didn't get any information about that so I'm just thinking, this is not my department, but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost, Advanced chip. Okay. Rubber material. Uh the case would be doubly curved. So So we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy. Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case? This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at. S see this is the the the standard traditional type, where the form uh yeah serves the function, you know. But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that. And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions. where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold. And Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children. So Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually, 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours, and with a lot of shape. Yeah, and the and the rubber, it it will look cheap always, Okay but the the colours, you you can make it uh make the colours with LEDs uh beneath the the buttons. If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it. And this is, this is with the curved that I mean. Well we could make a compromise between that. Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved. So to appeal a little more to the all the public. Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then? I would go for the double curved. I mean our aim is to make something different right? And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette, where you have the shape for your thumb. but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons. You can make a trigger button or something like	The project manager ran through the group's decisions so far and led a discussion of their remaining options, including the colour of the case and buttons, and whether the remote should flip open or not.
One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option. I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present. But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options, for the simple buttons? For for everything, in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated. Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control. And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options. but this is the the the simple uh layout. Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button. And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous so that's an a also an option.	The user interface designer talked about speech recognition and what functions will be controlled through buttons or the lcd screen menu.
So we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy. Uh the case would be doubly curved. So Rubber material.	The group decided on using kinetic energy, and a double-curved rubber case.
I'm dealing with the components design. I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products. Uh for example the energy source. we have four types. The basic battery. Uh we have a hand dynamo, Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing, if you shake it. And uh of course solar cells. for the uh a case, there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case. Single curved, which means that it has uh curves in one dimension. Or the double curved. but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now. Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic, the wood and the titanium. I would definitely go for rubber We have yeah several uh interface designs. Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus, but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons, for the the arrow buttons. the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production, 'cause they they can print it better. I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make. But it is more longlasting, that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again. and especially when the material's rubber. It can be done, I mean, you can't harm it, No it means curved in two dimensions. So double curved is like this, this, this, or So uh w single curved? Uh let's say would be a b square box, but then with curves on one dimension.	The industrial designer talked about the options for energy source, case shape and material, and internal components.
Okay but the the colours, you you can make it uh make the colours with LEDs uh beneath the the buttons. If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it. How about we do a uh a pop-up screen, like the laptop. If you can uh flip. But I dunno if that's too expensive. Okay so the buttons are on top here, and you flip it over that way. and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically. So okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open. Well yeah the the idea of it was, is that because you close it, you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever. We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break. I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like? Like some soft green or something? Orange or something. and then and then very bright, uh a yellow banana, an orange, uh a green apple, stuff like that, Yeah w we need very primary colours, like bright red, bright yellow. Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control. If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour, then it's just a neutral colour, So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess. Yeah with some some yellow banana I mean, the the colour of the background of the display? So just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that. maybe a maybe a white a white backlight? But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours? So th the total of the thing is very bright? But then then again, which colour should the buttons be? But maybe the buttons, all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people. Red and green are	The group were unsure about whether the remote should flip open or not and had trouble agreeing on a colour scheme.
Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved. So to appeal a little more to the all the public. Well we could make a compromise between that. Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then? I would go for the double curved. I mean our aim is to make something different right? but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons. So then you have double double curved in some way.	The group were unsure whether to use a single- or double-curved case.
I'm just thinking, this is not my department, but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost, I didn't get any information about that so	The group were unsure whether they would be able to produce their design for 12.5 euros as they had not yet received any information about costs.
So double curved is like this, this, this, or No it means curved in two dimensions. So uh w single curved? Uh let's say would be a b square box, but then with curves on one dimension.	The group were unsure about the difference between a single- and double-curved case.
. I did get a bit more done than the last time, 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there, and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint, so it takes me forever to get something done with it.	The industrial designer continued to have problems using power point, and felt that he did not have enough time to prepare his presentation.
Oh yeah, we have to do the project uh evaluation. So how were did the project process uh go? Did you, were you all pleased with the process as it was? Yeah well at first I was really stressed. Because it went a bit fast. But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on, the second time I think I did a bit better. because at first you you make your individual contribution, and then come here, and you have no idea what the others have to make. And then finally you have some idea, okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that, and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own. So The process, I mean, the interaction between us became better and better I guess. Yeah. Especially after the first meeting. Well you did become more assertive the the second time round, so that Um was there uh enough room for creativity? but only the the financial parts uh Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means of uh the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that. So and the uh about the board digital pen? the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard. Because it it it just works better. But the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. And uh as I said, uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works, so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation. Okay, are are there any new ideas about this? It's use especially useful, I guess, to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff. I think the PowerPoint is is too limited. Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the	The project manager led an evaluation of the project process.
The process, I mean, the interaction between us became better and better I guess. Yeah. Especially after the first meeting.	The group thought that they worked well together, especially after the first meeting.
makes three point one one one one one one one. So we're better than average.	The group were satisfied with the overall score of 3.1.
Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours? Yeah we we can just uh use this one. And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh The the button has a special colour, the frame has a special colour. Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED. Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far. And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet. but maybe you can help me. Okay, but how do we make the the scroll uh button? The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables, like primary colours, spongy shape. Yeah, is it's horizontal or vertical? Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance. It's not very fashionable anymore. But uh it's okay. Maybe that's a s a special colour for it. So we can make it uh special? uh can we do a print? I'm not sure. Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty? We have the original balance sheet, or Okay, it's not the prettiest, I know. Maybe maybe it c it can say that. The Real Remote. Shall we do the logo in black or not? Well it's it's single single curved. But it's it's better to have in the front, this kind of shape, because it looks nice.	The industrial designer and user interface designer worked on a drawing of the new design, while the project manager and marketing manager worked on the final report.
That was exactly my point. Like let's drop all the buttons, and just make one I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway. So we'll just have to use it for everything. Integrated scroll-wheel push-button, yeah. we need one integrated button for everything then. But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons. if you lose the the Back, the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows, and the Menu button. With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing. Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down. So Okay. Make it a special colour and then it look fancy.	They decided to drop all the buttons in favour of an integrated scroll push-button, and to use a hand dynamo instead of kinetic energy as a power source.
I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings? I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative. Yeah, but there are no negative questions I guess. So it were all positive questions, by uh by purpose. So Yeah true. Yes, so the It tells us something, yes.	The industrial designer was unsure about the value of the evaluation score.
Um was there uh enough room for creativity? but only the the financial parts uh Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means of uh	They were happy with the room for creativity, but thought they were limited by the budget.
It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing.	The group felt they should have been given the information about costs before designing the prototype.
We all have to keep in mind what has changed now. So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements. Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale, as following. Well the criteria are based on the user requirements, uh the trends from the marketing research, and the marketing strategy of the company itself. And we all have to uh agree on a certain level. Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user. I think it does. Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_, Okay well I say still two, but it has to be three then. The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions. Yeah. Well, yeah. So it it's a very true point. I mean it hides all those function. It shows the relevant and most used functions. It automatically has the the programme and the volume function, Okay five. Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition. Yeah, I say two. Okay, it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints, primary colours and sponge-like material. So we still uh we still have the primary colours. But only on the on the outside, not on the button. Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve. It should have been two questions. I realise now, because sponge-like material is dropped.. So maybe in the middle or something. Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one. I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape, that would give it something young and fresh. Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo. But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo. I mean, if there's only one thing. And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_, The remote control is easy to use. Skill, uh I would say six	The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation, based on the new design.
Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved? Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then. Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine, so you can't directly access a channel, but instead use only the up and down arrows. But we don't have any basic options any more. They don't need special colours. So let's go for the plastic. So the only option is an hand dynamo. drop the the special colour, and uh do the special colour for the buttons. Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour.	The group discussed which features should be dropped.
Yeah, I have still ten minutes to finish the report.	The project manager will complete the final report.
I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway. So we'll just have to use it for everything. Could drop the speech recognition. There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Let's drop the speech.	The group decided that the LCD screen was integral to their design, but dropped the speech recognition.
the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that. So and the uh about the board digital pen? the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard. Because it it it just works better. But the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. And uh as I said, uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works, so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation. I think the PowerPoint is is too limited. Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well. Yeah. But it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience, and then to	They preferred the digital pens to the SMARTboard.  They had mixed feelings about using PowerPoint.
Okay. Uh first of all I'll start with the costs, because that's going to influence our design. Because we have a problem. It has to be twelve and a half. You're going to redesign something. Okay, so we're at twenty five.	The project manager decided to start by looking at costs instead of the prototype presentation because the original design was too expensive and had to be changed.
Because we have a problem. It has to be twelve and a half. You're going to redesign something. Okay, so we're at twenty five.	The group's original design was too expensive, costing 25 Euros, so the remote had to be substantially redesigned.
So the only option is an hand dynamo. Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then.	The remote will be powered by a hand dynamo instead of kinetic energy.
I mean we have to drop on everything. Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine, so you can't directly access a channel, but instead use only the up and down arrows. But we don't have any basic options any more. But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons. Could drop the speech recognition. There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen.	The group were unsure about which features to drop and which to keep.
Yeah. Let's drop the speech.	The remote will no longer feature speech recognition, but will still have an LCD screen.
Integrated scroll-wheel push-button, yeah. we need one integrated button for everything then. With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing.	It will have one integrated scroll push-button and no other buttons.
So let's go for the plastic.	It will be made of plastic instead of rubber.
Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose. uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes. you uh will have uh individual actions Um the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design. Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions.	The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the working design and the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions.
now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things. You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself, at home. What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature. What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others. I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels. And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible. Uh So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose. And uh by making it multi-purpose, it uh has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from uh from current products. Um maybe some other technology than infrared. Uh I rather find it very annoying um, like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it. Um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth. That might be a little bit uh expensive. Um And something like an L_C_D_ screen. that um, when you're on a certain channel, you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or it must be really uh innovative, technical-wise? you got some cheap uh remote controls there. you got a dozen of 'em. But when you enter a new market with a remote control and uh wanna gain market share you have to do something special, I think. Uh at the beginning of such a project, it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about, well, this would be cool, that would be cool. Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh And and the price.	The group discussed their initial ideas of features to include in the design; the Marketing Expert discussed usability features, such as the ability to control multiple devices and an LCD screen, to make the product unique.
But our marketing range is uh, market range is international. So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to.	He explained that the device would be sold internationally.
Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro, and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro. from my point of view, I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech, high definition, uh ultra modern uh kinda remote, for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro. Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro. Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five, uh uh you got two million, two million remotes.	The Project Manager presented the project budget and explained that the device would not be made very high-tech due to the small budget.
little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other. At uh the white board on the left. Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal, and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal. Uh important is that we use different colours, and uh different pen widths. Widths. Widths. and he's called Simba. Miniature size? So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion. It is a turtle. Um 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles. It's a dog. we had a dog, a few years ago. when it died we didn't get a new one or something. It's the white rabbit from The Matrix. Yeah, exactly.	The group acquainted themselves with the materials by drawing on the smartboard.
the tool training. Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing. This one is for the presentations, the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had. We have two smart boards. Um and as you uh may have heard, the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen. Not in y the the My Documents. Uh This uh is very straightforward, with the save, the print, the undo, the blank, the select, the pen.	He then introduced and explained how to use the meeting-room materials.
Uh this is the agenda for today. Uh first a little opening. Uh I will introduce myself, uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself. Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance, acquaintance to uh to to ourselves. Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards. Then the project plan. Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end. Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control. Uh first of all uh it must be original, uh and trendy. But at the same time uh user-friendly. Uh there are three stages. There is a functional design. Then the conceptual design.	The Project Manager introduced the aim of the project and gave a brief agenda for the entire project.
my name is uh Danny Wolfs. I'm the Project Manager. I'm Juergen Toffs. I'm the User Interface Designer. my name's uh. I'm the Industrial Designer. Um my function is the Marketing Expert. I'm uh Tim.	The participants introduced themselves and their roles to each other.
we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make. I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually. That's a phase further. make some mock-ups, some some general ideas. But maybe, because uh you are working on the user requirements, you are working on the technical functions, we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh Consensus on the, what we're gonna do. So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all. I don't know. if the technical functions have to be designed, I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be. th that's that's really a step further. we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it, or how it has to be like. And then in the next meeting we decide And then you s then you can delete uh the o the obsolete uh details. each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important. And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting.	The group discussed the timing of when they would make decisions on the features discussed.
I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels. And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible. Uh So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose. Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose. And uh by making it multi-purpose, it uh has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from uh from current products.	The group could not decide whether or not the remote should be able to control multiple devices.
it must be really uh innovative, technical-wise? you have to do something special, I think. you got some cheap uh remote controls there. you got a dozen of 'em. But when you enter a new market with a remote control and uh wanna gain market share Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose. And uh by making it multi-purpose, it uh has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from uh from current products.	The group decided that it was important to incorporate a feature that would make the product very unique.
Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions.	The User Interface Designer will research the technical functions.
Um the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design.	The Industrial Designer will work on the working design.
we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make. I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually. That's a phase further. make some mock-ups, some some general ideas. But maybe, because uh you are working on the user requirements, you are working on the technical functions, we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh Consensus on the, what we're gonna do. So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all. I don't know. if the technical functions have to be designed, I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be. th that's that's really a step further. we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it, or how it has to be like.

And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting.	The group had difficulties deciding when to make decisions on the features they mentioned in their discussion.
but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder, is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote. If somebody says, where is the remote, then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something, maybe uh maybe something to look into, I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be.	He suggests adding a speech function, when someone asks where the remote is and it beeps.
Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components. The energy source would be a battery, simple uh battery I figured that would be best, Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button, but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch when a button is prush pushed in, uh a electric current goes through here, and in uh immediately, a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened. That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking, well uh did the button be pressed, w what happened uh. the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb my personal preferences here, we have to keep it simple. Not too many uh gadgets and functions, Uh I I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving. I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that, because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too, I think current T_V_s can even send infrared. but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control? 'Cause that would be I mean extra components, extra designs, um larger g uh remote control. So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all. we should uh look into the design and the functionability. Like I said, uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions, just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something, the usual uh stuff. we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions, but we we should stick to the basics.	He also explains the various components, materials, and energy sources of a remote, giving preference to a remote with multifunctional buttons and without a receiver.
I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions. Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design, technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one, so if you um going to design a remote that looks good, that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make, of course, but also the user friendliness, And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult, so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote. And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen, but s I don't know in how far that is possible, since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything, but uh we might uh consider that. So just keep it simple, make clear buttons, easy to use. I prefer to use it only for T_V_ and and if possible, uh the buttons should give a dr direct action, not first select you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one, and so that's where the difficulties lie. Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original, or uh multi-purpose as we thought, or do we want to use um many buttons. it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen um, that in the middle are the the main keys, just uh in the middle the general functions, like play, uh channel switching, and then uh at the top or at the bottom, some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down. Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_? Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes? 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_, you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay	The interface specialist presents, talking about the possible components of the remote and concluding that the remote should be simple and accessible without too much functionality.
uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff, like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control, um speech recognition. I don't think that's uh really appropriate. Um, and when you see uh the audience, the age is going up uh Yeah, they don't really want it anymore, at least the new technologies. Second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls. First point is, seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly, uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation, um following buttons are most important. Switching channels, um yeah, Um the second, teletext, uh and the third, uh volume controls. But it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet. but uh at the moment uh teletext is Yeah, th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_, like getting information. they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control.	The marketing expert explains various user preferences and complaints about remotes as well as different interests among age groups.
my personal preferences. Um, I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five. Mm, first of all um it's the biggest share, the biggest audience, sixty five percent. Uh second, I think you will get the most revenue from i from it. we have to impro improve the most used functions, as I said here, switching channels, teletext and volume controls. uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller, so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the, yeah, of the T_V_ that's a cool idea. When you mentioned uh improving functions, what uh what do you mean by that but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control. So you can have a remote control full of buttons, a hundreds hundreds of buttons, but if you don't use them, yeah it's so focusing more on the used buttons. but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions, like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example. Yeah, perhaps.	He prefers that they aim users from ages 16-45, improve the most-used functions, and make a placeholder for the remote.
I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project. what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked, uh what kind of components are involved, And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds. And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works	The industrial designer begins explaining the working design.
what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared, And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something, and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared, so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate, so that would mean extra cost for the user So that's probably why most controls are still infrared. Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure, uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote. because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth or or radio waves, What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_, connected to the T_V_? I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice, but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function.	He talks about existing products, most of which use infared since it is simple and cost-effective.
welcome back. At the functional design meeting um uh I had an email from the from the management board but there were four points uh which uh I think are very important. First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated Uh second one is also important Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television, so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control, Uh second, and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert, uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older, but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty. I think to keep in mind, but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote.	When this functional design meeting opens the project manager tells  the group about the project restrictions he received from management by email.
I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level, The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire. Um one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results. two audiences, Uh the first one, this scale, from sixteen to forty five age. Uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five. Um, as you can see here, the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five. Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent.	The marketing expert is first to present, summarizing user requirements data from a questionaire given to 100 respondents.
You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work.	They will fill out the questionaire
Uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email.	They will receive specific instructions for the next meeting by email.
th th those things are nice. but I think that's we wel later in the stage. and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is, but have the opportunity to uh have more options	The group has brought up a number of technological possibilities, have conflicting views about them, and have not yet made decisions about them.
uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen, uh and uh the the the the other functions, the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen, but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers You can display actual buttons on the touch screens. but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience. W we are aiming for younger people A touch screen, like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications. I th I think we can do that too.	The group is interested in incorporating a touch screen by that could be too difficult to use, especially for elderly people.
So we have now a lunch break, finally, Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work, once again uh thirty minutes. Uh I will put my minutes so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too. Uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email. You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work.	The group closes the meeting and goes to lunch.
but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something. especially the important buttons, um if you want to switch channel, change your volume, uh use teletext, it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote, behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen. I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good. Um, because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people. Um, they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up, because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something. Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen? The extra functions. you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions, and you just choose one, Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen, uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet and uh we have three of those, uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus, with or sub-items, sub-functions. then I'd like to make a proposal. If you make one big touch screen, keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest. So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen. that they always um make the same buttons accessible, so use just for special options a part of the touch screen. an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions, you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions. I had another uh idea about maybe parental control. Um, like	The group continues the meeting by having discussion about the possibility of a touch screen, LCD, and other functions.
Okay. So the games uh are in it. The parental control will be incorporated, but it must be not too complex.	The remote will include games and a simple parental control feature.
And um, things like teletext, put them in the menu. But um, well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure.	Most features will be controlled through the menu.
But, the main concept is um take one big touch screen. Um, always display the primary buttons clear and visible. And uh make the menu structure changeable. One thing you've gotta keep in mind, keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time. But um, well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure. And um, things like teletext, put them in the menu.	The user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons.
Welcome to the conceptual design meeting Uh uh, also this time there will be uh three presentations. And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts. Um uh, and at the end, uh I uh, when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh visited. information. I will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder.	The project manager went over the agenda.
But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic. Or you can go for both? I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well, the costs aren't that much higher, and um, ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery. Or but but you could go in a in an double curves. And that's like several different dimensions. Yeah, that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look, I f I figured. Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity. I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh Yeah.	He recommended using kinetic energy, and having a double-curved rubber case.
I'll be talking about the components. Uh, what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups. Uh below forty five and above. senior citizens uh They, well, they like more the they like the traditional materials, like wood and and such more. And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes. where whereas the young and dynamic, they like a more uh soft materials. Uh uh, soft and fluffy and colourful and But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic. Or you can go for both? But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light. Uh, and you you could you could use normal light, but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something. I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well, the costs aren't that much higher, and um, ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery. But, what l what Jarek said, you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves. Or but but you could go in a in an double curves. And that's like several different dimensions. Yeah, that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look, I f I figured. Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity. I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh Yeah. Well, we discussed it in a previous meeting, so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_. Uh, you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too. but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen, and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen. That's it's custom customisable and uh so what are the opinions? Uh rubber or plastic?	The industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source, materials and components.
I have a little problems with my laptop. And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete. Um, it didn't work anymore. The entire Windows uh	The user interface designer had problems with his laptop while he was preparing his presentation.
I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching. In Paris and Milan, we uh asked different people, uh differing in age and in income, uh the amount of money to spend, um what they like in design uh and material nowadays. Our main audience, uh so that's people below forty, uh prefer the following. At first, the colours of fruit. Um, fresh colours, uh green, red, uh strawberry red, uh yellow, banana yellow. Yeah. They like spongy material, Okay, our secondary audience, uh people above forty a forty years in age, they like the dark traditional colours. Yeah, uh materials like wood that They have to look fancy. Um, they should be technological in innovative. Uh, and easy to use. We have to aim at a mu at the main audience. And uh, therefore use fresh colours. Here, think about removable covers, as seen in mobile telephon telephone market. To customise your own remote control. Uh, in my second sheet of personal preferences, uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition. You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies, like speak uh speech recognition and stuff. Uh, building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users. And third, I stick with it, the log-in functionality uh with the slogan, take parental control to a new dimension.	The marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material.
I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with. I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote. How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents, children. You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings. You c may use like when there's uh X_P_, uh a simple log-on, d you just push uh one or two or three. I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it. Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it, Just make through a remote as it is, but make an option to insert profiles, I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control, uh let's say we do, and and well whatever, cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance. What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control. Okay. And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition? But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh, hearing loud noises from the T_V_, someone screaming one, and you f the channel switches, uh Yeah. Yeah, like f voice recognition is too much, I think. But Okay. So the games uh are in it. The voice recognition are not. And the parental control are Well, I think also it's a good idea, buts very difficult to incorporate. Like the first idea uh from uh You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh I I figure if you had two different remotes, you could bo choose	The group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition.
But, what l what Jarek said, you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves. Uh, you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too.	The group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy.
Yeah, like f voice recognition is too much, I think. But The voice recognition are not.	It will not use speech recognition.
We have to aim at a mu at the main audience. And uh, therefore use fresh colours. Here, think about removable covers, as seen in mobile telephon telephone market. To customise your own remote control. Uh, in my second sheet of personal preferences, uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition. You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies, like speak uh speech recognition and stuff. Uh, building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users. And third, I stick with it, the log-in functionality uh with the slogan, take parental control to a new dimension.	He suggested using removable customisable covers, speech recognition, installing some games into the remote, and implementing a parental control feature.
They have to look fancy. Um, they should be technological in innovative. Uh, and easy to use.	He explained that the remote should look fancy, and be technologically innovative and easy to use.
N Uh, next meeting starts in thirty minutes. the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype. And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard. And um, the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation. But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email. But I think it was a very uh very good uh session, uh gentlemen. But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh	The project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting.
I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing. When you uh put on remote, you see a kind of a just like when you telephone, you see a little uh animation. And uh with the with the with the motto, we put fashion in electronics. Well, if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen, you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom. That spins around like all the time. It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer.	The group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote, including having an animated logo on the touch screen.
I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us. First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management. Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge, uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that. It's it's uh very hot at the moment, so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote, just some uh Yeah. Import export.	The project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management.
How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents, children. You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings. You c may use like when there's uh X_P_, uh a simple log-on, d you just push uh one or two or three. I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it. Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it, Just make through a remote as it is, but make an option to insert profiles, I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control, uh let's say we do, and and well whatever, cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance. What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control. Well, I think also it's a good idea, buts very difficult to incorporate. And the parental control are Like the first idea uh from uh You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh I I figure if you had two different remotes, you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it. Well, maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs, where the parent says, you cannot watch channel seven, nine, and ten, and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock. But you still have the problem about uh the television itself. You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem.	The group were unsure about how to implement a parental control feature, or if it would be worth the time and money.
The parental control will be incorporated, but it must be not too complex.	After a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature.
Well, we discussed it in a previous meeting, so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_. The buttons will be uh touch-screen. Uh but there may not be too many buttons.	There will be a touch screen and not many buttons.
I I I prefer rubber. The case will be double-curved and uh rubber, in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable.	The case will be double-curved and made of rubber, with fruity-coloured removable covers.
I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too. Uh, you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. Okay. So uh I think we have decided on the things that Uh from Janus, the energy, the combination between battery and kinetic.	The energy source will be a combination of batteries and kinetic energy.
the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype. And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard. And um, the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation.	The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype, using the SMARTboard.  The marketing expert will work on the product evaluation.
now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project. was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings? But, that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us. I I didn't think so. That there was a lot of room for it. and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff. Bu Well, I th I think you two, uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel, you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project. I think Jeroen and I, we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two. Uh how about the leadership? I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting. but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more. So like, I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting, and I was a I was also very uh unhappy, uh very unsatisfied uh about the and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk Yeah, more more consensus. No, it you did better. Uh, teamwork? Well, we work together on a project, but everybody has his own task. and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. But, really teamwork were you two uh Nah. Yeah, we we had some trouble with the pen, but D uh just write your name right now. Uh he he knows how it works, yeah. The idea is great, but it doesn't work properly. Uh It's it's not real real use for me. I it's the same concept as the pen, where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow. Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things, And the eraser was another problem. M Abo What kind of new ideas? Well, the the idea of the touch-screen is uh New ideas	The project manager led the evaluation of the project process.
Well, I th I think you two, uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel, you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project. I think Jeroen and I, we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two. Well, we work together on a project, but everybody has his own task. and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. But, really teamwork were you two uh	The group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team.
I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting. but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more. So like, I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting, and I was a I was also very uh unhappy, uh very unsatisfied uh about the and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk Yeah, more more consensus. No, it you did better.	It was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings.
And and for colours, we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey. Those are the technological colours actually, It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable, so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple, but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control, it would be less appealing than a white one. And young people, we think, are a little bit more flexible, they think, ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover, so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop. um I think a cover is necessary, So, there must be some cheap standard cover, Yeah, but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people. So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard, and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated, more traditional look, they're willing to pay uh that. Yeah. Yeah, maybe yeah, perhaps you're right. Uh, maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style. a wood style, a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours. And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour, but not too not too much. But, the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours. Not too, but w a little,	The group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours, but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers.
Um, now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements. Um, we're going to do that with a seven point scale. We have to uh be consensive about about things. We're going to vote. The remote control is designed for people with age below forty. Yeah, it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty. It's also designed for people above forty. Yeah, two or three, The remote control is beautiful. acco according to us, it's one? Or Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product. Uh, the remote control looks fancy. One? The remote control has big, clear channel switching buttons. Yeah yeah, Uh, teletext buttons and volume buttons? Teletext is in the menu. Volume is true. Yeah, the they are big and clear.. I would give it a more a five or a six. The remote control is easy to be found. Uh well, when we put in fancy colours, yeah Yeah, it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape. If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed, or you throw this remote control under your bed, is it better findable? It'll make a difference. Well, we p we can do it glow in the dark. Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false. uh, w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls, there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room, this one will stand out, I think. if this lying on your couch, you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing. If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer, uh you find it, yeah? But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it. Yeah, that's stupid. Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it. Uh the remote control has fresh, fruity colours. Um I would call uh choose two, 'cause we decided not to make two	The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product.
Okay, we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost. Yeah, if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro, uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation, as we have uh experienced it. Otherwise, we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy. So Kinetic, one. Battery, yes. One. Advanced chip. So it's only uh once double-curved. We're now in a problem, 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet. Then we'll see uh we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget. Special uh is the special colour? Yeah, but we want to make uh the wood colours, uh that uh No, this is a standard colour. Yes, this is a special colour. Yeah, if if you're honest, we'll uh type one, special colour. Yeah, but but D but Daniel, tha that's that's another brand. That's another article Well, we're only four Euro over budget.	The group calculated the production costs.
Well, we're only four Euro over budget. Well, other case, we can make it single-curved or uncurved. Mm, single-curves. The kinetic thing, can we just skip it, because uh you have to shake it, but that's not really innovative. What do you think about uh putting a battery in it, but also selling like uh the covers, a docking station But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway, just you s you have to recharge them manual. well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved. so we have to bake the ba back flat, and then No, it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think. Or but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look. No advanced chip, uh that's a little bit of problem. So, if we do this, uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro. Uh, there's an a a athe aesthetic value, but not functionality. If you make it double-curved, it costs one Euro more. But I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price. Yeah, well let's assume it is. But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion. No, well, y I mean uh, y you can go into your neighbour and tell him, ha, my k uh remote control is kinetic. Yeah, but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile. So because if you want to go to kinetic, you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat, and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise Well, we were above, so we did a little redesign	The group were 4 euros over budget, so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy.
Um, once again I'm uh gonna take minutes. Uh, first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_. Uh evaluation crit criteria. Uh, in combination with the finance I um uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file which we have to fill in later on. Uh, and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro. And after that, uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard, with the with our laptops, with the all uh all this. Once again, forty minutes,	The project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda.
Nah. Yeah, we we had some trouble with the pen, but D uh just write your name right now. Uh he he knows how it works, yeah. The idea is great, but it doesn't work properly. Uh It's it's not real real use for me. I it's the same concept as the pen, where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow. Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things,	The group were also had problems with the digital pens.
I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation. Shall I give a short introduction and then uh Yeah, well sure. Um, this was our first concept. We decided to use a single touch-screen. And um, well, we began with uh with a form of shape, that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand, left or right handed. Um well, during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top, usable with your thumb, and uh the menu structure, uh if necessary, with your other hand, Yeah, uh well, and as you saw, we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen. Well, these would be the main buttons, h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to. We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here. We have the sub-menus and stu stuff. As you can see, this uh there, there are uh two uh weird bumps in it. This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic. And so when you put it on the table, it will just lay down. The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers, But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff. you can make a more thinner uh design, So, you have room here for your battery S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip. Uh, you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior. it's like an uh Easter egg. Yeah, it's like an e but this is for children. We we want a more adult version. So this actually basic the idea. We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this.	The user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design, describing the shape and layout of the remote.
because uh there must be some kind of end report. Uh about all the meetings, what we have decided, here is uh standing uh whoa, we can celebrate now, but the end report is You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report. Maybe we can do it uh together. So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board. Um, this is about the functional design, but you can save it u the under another name. It's a read-only version. about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control. Um, it must be uh simple to use, very clear what to do, and at the younger people. No, you have to put uh, switch channels uh at the top, because that's the most used function and teletext at the second a volume changing, second. S switch, yes. then the conceptual design. Well, okay, maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost. Uh, he here it is still double-curve, the rubber, the flashy, the fruity, the removable. It's not double. Nay but that this is what um Was initial, the plan. The initial plan. And the the added functions like Tetris snake, the added functions. Uh, was it included in the cost? I don't think so, eh? Okay, so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh Yeah, the end conclusion. that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now. Yeah, but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion, I think. well I gonna redesign uh something now. Oh, before you change anything maybe you um save it first. Finish meeting now. I'm going to finish my end report.	The group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting.
that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now. I'm going to finish my end report.	The project manager will finish the final report.
And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour, but not too not too much. But, the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours. So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard, and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated, more traditional look, they're willing to pay uh that.	The remote will come in fruity colours as standard with the option of buying different exchangeable covers.
Mm, single-curves. well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved.	The case will be single-curved instead of double-curved.
The kinetic thing, can we just skip it, because uh you have to shake it, but that's not really innovative.	The remote will be battery powered and will no longer use kinetic energy.
Well, we're only four Euro over budget.	The production costs were 4 euros over budget.
Well, other case, we can make it single-curved or uncurved. Mm, single-curves. The kinetic thing, can we just skip it, because uh you have to shake it, but that's not really innovative. What do you think about uh putting a battery in it, but also selling like uh the covers, a docking station But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway, just you s you have to recharge them manual. well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved. so we have to bake the ba back flat, and then No, it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think. Or but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look. No advanced chip, uh that's a little bit of problem. If you make it double-curved, it costs one Euro more. Uh, there's an a a athe aesthetic value, but not functionality. But I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price. Yeah, well let's assume it is. But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion. No, well, y I mean uh, y you can go into your neighbour and tell him, ha, my k uh remote control is kinetic. Yeah, but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile. So because if you want to go to kinetic, you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat, and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise	Which features should be changed to reduce production costs.
I I didn't think so. That there was a lot of room for it. But, that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us. and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff. Bu Well, I th I think you two, uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel, you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project. I think Jeroen and I, we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two. Well, we work together on a project, but everybody has his own task. and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. But, really teamwork were you two uh	There were not enough opportunities for creativity and teamwork.
Nah. Yeah, we we had some trouble with the pen, but D uh just write your name right now. Uh he he knows how it works, yeah. The idea is great, but it doesn't work properly. Uh It's it's not real real use for me. I it's the same concept as the pen, where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow. Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things,	The digital pens did not work very well.
Do you know how how I can wake it up? I've lost my screen. Uh Never close your laptop.	The marketing expert and industrial designer had problems with their laptops.
Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder, and not with a stereo, I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players, recorders. I thought it was only for television. So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_. Yeah, but most television remote controls support other functions as well.	The group were not sure whether the remote control should include functions for controlling video and DVD players, or if it should only be for television.
And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros.	The profit aim is 15 million Euros.
The market range is international, so it's gonna be sold world-wide,	The remote will be sold internationally.
Well, welcome to the kick-off meeting. Well, this is the agenda for today. examples of the tool training, project plan discussion and the closing. Okay, the project aim is to design a new remote control. Uh, some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly. Um, I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part, but we we all know each other. Uh we begin with the functional design, then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design. Every uh level of design consists of some individual work, and we uh close it with a meeting.	The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, to design a remote control.
Do you know how how I can wake it up? I've lost my screen. Uh Never close your laptop.	The marketing expert and industrial designer had problems with their laptops.
Okay, first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here, so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools. This is the presentation boards, wh which one I'm using right now. there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder. so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen. There is a tool-bar over here. It's like a very simple uh paint application. and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button. and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward, Right, we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards. Uh, every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics, Well, I'm gonna draw um a p piranha. Uh, a fish. And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths. but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird. and then we are uh through the tool training, I guess.	The project manager explained how to use the SMARTboard, and the group did a tool training exercise, using the SMARTboard to draw their favourite animals.
The User Interface Designer the technical functions design.	The user interface designer will work on the technical functions design.
Uh, some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly.	The remote should be trendy, original and user friendly.
And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert. User requirements specifi	The marketing expert will work on user requirements.
well, we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be. I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls, but if you see elderly people, all these buttons, and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever. Uh, so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons, you know. And uh, is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment, like your T_V_ and your home stereo? Or someth something special, like uh M_P_ three player inside of it, or uh Okay. Maybe with different type of fronts or uh	The group discussed initial ideas for the remote, including that it should be a simple design with grouped buttons.
Okay, this is uh something about the project finance. The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros. And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros. The market range is international, so it's gonna be sold world-wide, and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control.	The project manager talked about the budget and projected profit.
The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros.	The remote will be sold for 25 Euros.
The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design, of course, The User Interface Designer the technical functions design. And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert. User requirements specifi I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes. We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes.	The project manager went over the roles of the participants and closed the meeting.
and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control.	It will cost no more than 12.5 Euros to make.
Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder, and not with a stereo, I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players, recorders. I thought it was only for television. So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_. Yeah, but most television remote controls support other functions as well.	They discussed whether the remote should include functions for controlling video and DVD players.
I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes.	The project manager will write up the meeting minutes and put them in the project folder.
Uh, some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly.	The group will design a trendy, original and user friendly television remote control.
The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design, of course,	The industrial designer will work on the working design.
Well, I think that may be so, but well, we can't just leave the teletext button off. So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button, you know, like on and off, I think we should just put one teletext button on it.	Even though the new project requirements stated that teletext was outdated, the group felt they should still include one teletext button.
I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to, No, yeah, th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But just the basic functions. Maybe like rewind and wind, No, new requirements say no. Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh	The group were still unsure whether to include some DVD/VCR functions on the remote.
But i in a way we have to be uh uh special. Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that? How we can what the extra touch can be. Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it, Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing. so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something. a swapable front or whatever. Yeah, or just different colours would be uh I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control.	The group had difficulty deciding what special feature they should include to make their product stand out.
Welcome at the functional design meeting, again presented by Maarten. Uh, we've got three presentations. And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me.	The project manager opened the meeting.
and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions, more buttons, maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that. Uh, I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh	He suggested that a trendy design should not have many buttons.
I in in the base we could like make uh a button, and if you push it, the remote control itself s makes noise. Yeah, you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table. If you do that, but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros. And then also you don't even need batteries, because you can make it uh chargeable. but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control, then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know, rechargeable units. Well, maybe yeah, you could when that's when it's too costly, you could probably skip the recharger, On the other hand, if you don't do it, we can also make a nice bay. I mean, it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it, And and what people just think about, well, I'll never have to buy any r batteries again, so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty.	The group were not sure whether to include a base/recharger for the remote.
Alright, I've done some research for functional requirements. there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people, uh how do you say uh, f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions. So if we make a trendy design, we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market, which you can reach. Um, three out of four users uh zaps a lot, as I uh quoted here from the uh results. Furthermore, fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control. Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room. Um, all the settings, about audio settings, video settings and channel settings, which are not very often used, we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever, And a trendy look, well uh, although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever, I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent.	The marketing expert reported on user requirements, including how users rated the importance of different features.
Well, they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet. Well, I think that may be so, but well, we can't just leave the teletext button off. So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button, you know, like on and off, The remote control should only be used for television. Otherwise, the project becomes more complex, which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market. Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design.	The remote is only for TV, should not include a teletext feature, and should feature the company colour and slogan.
If you do that, but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros. but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control, then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know, rechargeable units. Well, maybe yeah, you could when that's when it's too costly, you could probably skip the recharger,	They were not sure how much a recharger would cost to make.
So if we make a trendy design, we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market, which you can reach. Um, three out of four users uh zaps a lot, as I uh quoted here from the uh results. Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room.	He stressed that a trendy design is important, that users zap a lot, and that remotes often get lost.
That means we can uh well d yeah, discuss on the remote control functions. Yeah, we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions. I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to, No, yeah, th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But just the basic functions. Maybe like rewind and wind, No, new requirements say no. Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh Yeah, we we'll make w this one trendy. I think stop function is very useful. Yeah, yeah, but maybe you s yeah yeah, maybe y you do, but I've never heard of it in the first place. And I think we should just put one teletext button on it. I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present, No, okay, but we don't have to uh, when we don't want to uh control other devices, I think it makes it even more simple. uh uh the batteries maybe. If you use large batteries or small batter batteries. I think double A_. But i in a way we have to be uh uh special. Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that? How we can what the extra touch can be. Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing. Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it, so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something. So big buttons, flashy design, and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing. a swapable front or whatever. Yeah, or just different colours would be uh I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control. I in in the base we could like make uh a button, and if you push it, the remote control itself s	The group discussed what functions and features the remote should have, and whether to include DVD/VCR controls, a teletext button, stop button, changeable covers, and a base/recharger with locator function.
Well, then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements Well, they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet. Well, I think that may be so, but well, we can't just leave the teletext button off. So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button, you know, like on and off, The remote control should only be used for television. Otherwise, the project becomes more complex, which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market. New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty. It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty. Yeah, but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about, we already cover that. So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group, but isn't that bad for an older person either. Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design.	The project manager informed the group of new requirements.
Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape? Maybe like this pen. It has to feel nice in your hand. you should like make Alessi or something design it. Yeah, but twelve and a half Euros? Uh I think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something. Something like that is very ergonomic. And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it. It's also round. Maybe uh, I don't know, some some lights, a big but well. Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons. but I also meant the the blinking li w you know, the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote. maybe put something on top of it or, you know, like that's looks funny. I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then.	The group also discussed making the remote a rounded, ergonomic shape, and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost.
'Kay, we're going to um uh talk about working design. It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television. Uh, diodes, uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights, they're needed and they're uh everywhere available. Uh, the circuit board, it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control.	The industrial designer reported on working design, explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components.
I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes, the the s the next minutes won't be a problem, but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too,	The project manager will write up the minutes, and put the minutes from both this meeting and the previous one in the project folder.
Well, the technical functions. and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user. th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements, w if you want try a a a huge market, if you want to reach a huge market, uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user. Uh well, there are l at least uh basic functions, uh like just th the channels uh one till nine, uh on and off switch, which must be clear with a red button or something like that. Um, most standard uh have volume, of course, and a mute function, and, of course, the next and previous channel. and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions, more buttons, maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that. Uh, I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh	The user interface designer talked about what functions should be included.
We have lunch break, and then we have thirty minutes of individual work.	The marketing expert, industrial designer and user interface designer will have thirty minutes after lunch to work on their individual presentations.
and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user.	He suggested they should focus on either expert or novice users.
Yeah, we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions. Yeah, we we'll make w this one trendy. But i in a way we have to be uh uh special. Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that? How we can what the extra touch can be.	The remote will have a simple, trendy design, with some kind of special feature that makes it stand out.
Uh well, there are l at least uh basic functions, uh like just th the channels uh one till nine, uh on and off switch, which must be clear with a red button or something like that. Um, most standard uh have volume, of course, and a mute function, and, of course, the next and previous channel. three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly.	The basic functions should include an on/off switch, buttons for channels one to nine, volume, mute and buttons for next and previous channel.
Well, maybe yeah, you could when that's when it's too costly, you could probably skip the recharger, well, we will see what's possible concerning the the costs, and if it's possible we'll do that.	If the budget allows it the remote will include a base unit with a locator function, which will also act as a recharger.
Maybe just bring it out in different colours, but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards, that's also too much.	The remote will be available in different colour schemes, but not with changeable fronts.
But wha th our basic idea y I mean, you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials, like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it.	The case will be made of plastic and rubber.
You'll see in you email, I guess. What are we going to do now?	The rest of the group will receive instructions via email.
Okay, we s skip the L_C_D_ display.	The remote will not feature an LCD screen.
How many colours are we gonna give it? Like two-tone colour? T I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons, and the cushions as well should be in another colour. Not more than two colours I think. It's a g a little bit too flashy. I think colours is very important, because it has to be flashy, but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying, I think this is kind of fruity, you know. Just round shapes with uh	They were not sure how to use fruity colours without being too flashy.
Okay, well I think the meeting will be over within a minute. Well, you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the In the shared folder. because I'm will now type them out. You'll see in you email, I guess. What are we going to do now?	The project manager closed the meeting and told the group they would receive emails about their tasks for the next meeting.
But uh, from now on I won't use my pen anymore, so will be p just ordinary keyboard. Well, you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the In the shared folder. because I'm will now type them out.	The project manager will write up the minutes and put them in the shared folder, using a keyboard instead of the digital pen.
But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control? No, but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit. Yeah, but it that doesn't have to remind you, you know, like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit, but just, you know, like the the the the round curves. Well, w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things. And um, maybe, yeah, a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control, but m yeah. yeah, I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh, a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too. But pictures of fruit, vegetables vegetables Maybe it's too much, you know. But, we we have to um There have to be the the the the firm colours, our own uh colours has to be in it. But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable. If this is our docking station, we can make our logo over here. How many colours are we gonna give it? Like two-tone colour? T I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons, and the cushions as well should be in another colour. Not more than two colours I think. It's a g a little bit too flashy. I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions, pads and things on the s uh side. I think colours is very important, because it has to be flashy, but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying, I think this is kind of fruity, you know. Just round shapes with uh	The group discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, as well as the company colours and logo.
Well, it's nice, of course. But I don't I don't know what to display on it. do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display, for example? Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it, for the channel you're on. Yes sure, but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen, because Yeah, but no. I do I think it's a bit redundant, actually. Well well what would you display on it then? Uh, programme uh information or or or or g or a guide But you're already watching the T_V_, you're not gonna watch your remote control. I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it, But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image. When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it, it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from well, I'm coming back to the costs again, but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits. and really, I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything, you know, on a design level.	The industrial designer was keen to incorporate an LCD screen, but the others were not so sure.
The younger market likes uh Well, the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material. Uh, catchy colours. uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself. To implement some spongy thing, maybe we can do it in the in the docking station. Yeah, also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour.	The younger market also likes the theme of fruit and vegetables and spongy material, which could be implemented through fruity colours and using a spongy material for the base.
do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display, for example? Well, it's nice, of course. But I don't I don't know what to display on it. Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it, for the channel you're on. Yes sure, but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen, because Yeah, but no. I do I think it's a bit redundant, actually. Well well what would you display on it then? Uh, programme uh information or or or or g or a guide But you're already watching the T_V_, you're not gonna watch your remote control. I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it, But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image. When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it, it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from well, I'm coming back to the costs again, but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits. and really, I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything, you know, on a design level. Okay, we s skip the L_C_D_ display.	The group discussed whether to include an LCD screen, and eventually decided against it.
The m material, I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber. Uh But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium, as well? But it it then it uh you can't throw it it. It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff Uh, I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic. On the other hand, if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh	The group were not sure whether to use plastic and rubber or titanium for the case.
But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control? No, but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit. Yeah, but it that doesn't have to remind you, you know, like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit, but just, you know, like the the the the round curves. And um, maybe, yeah, a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control, but m yeah. Well, w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things. yeah, I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh, a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too. But pictures of fruit, vegetables vegetables Maybe it's too much, you know. I think this is kind of fruity, you know. Just round shapes with uh	The group were not sure to what extent the remote should incorporate the fruit and vegetable theme.
the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control. The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_. And uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance, the third point, is a high ease of use.	A fancy look and feel is most important to users, followed by technological innovation and ease of use.
Well, I've done some research again about trends on the internet. the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control. The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_. And uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance, the third point, is a high ease of use. The younger market likes uh Well, the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material. Uh, catchy colours. uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself. To implement some spongy thing, maybe we can do it in the in the docking station. Yeah, also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour.	The marketing expert gave a presentation on trend watching.
And I um uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small Well, w when we only use basic functions, we have the possibility to make the buttons larger. Well, I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons, th th those two have yeah, they have to be large. It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big, like t	The group discussed using large buttons for the most frequently used functions.
um, I still don't have any information about user requirements. I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh Oh, we decided upon that in the last meeting. Yeah, but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements. Well, tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi Well, I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of. these are the ones you already summed up in the Uh, I was also looking for what you said, for I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control. I don't know if that's a good idea, or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half. Production. I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it. Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting. But Um, yeah. Well, the functions are are not more to discuss, I think. It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no V_C_R_ or that kind of But you do mention the next and previous uh button. Well, that's next channel. I mean next channel. uh personal preference I didn't have. And I um uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small	The user interface designer went over the functions to be included in the remote.
Um, another possibility. I uh yeah, I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays. Could be uh something special to our uh remote control, and it's possible, but it only cost a bit more,	He also mentioned the possibility of using an LCD screen to add something special.
uh the basic battery, which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um Uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah, kinetic uh energy. Mm, solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls.	He also recommended using basic batteries rather than solar or kinetic power.
uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design, which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy. Uh uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber, because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird. Oh titanium is probably trendy, I think. Well, maybe a little bit expensive.	He suggested that the case should be double-curved, and be made from plastic and rubber rather than wood or titanium.
Th in that way we have like only the numbers, the power button, skip and volume, and then uh uh ten uh rem A mute and a teletext and a menu.	The remote will feature power, skip, volume, mute, teletext and menu buttons.
Uh, yeah. Uh, before we begin it, I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder, It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read, because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other. But uh, from now on I won't use my pen anymore, so will be p just ordinary keyboard.	The project manager had problems using the digital pen to write the minutes.
Okay, when we talk about uh components design, um it's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of. Uh the properties of the case, um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah, it feels uh good in your hand. I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case, we must use a rubber push-buttons to uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design, which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy. Uh uh the basic battery, which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um Uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah, kinetic uh energy. Mm, solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls. uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber, because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird. Oh titanium is probably trendy, I think. Well, maybe a little bit expensive. uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf. all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory. Um, another possibility. I uh yeah, I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays. Could be uh something special to our uh remote control, and it's possible, but it only cost a bit more, Yes, maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh I th I got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one.	The industrial designer talked about the options available for materials and components.
It w it won't tell, but No, this not gonna sell. No. Yeah, we just have to go all what we did today again. You have to do it over. No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left. Yeah, and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well, to give it some just to give it some extra special feature,	The group were dissatisfied with the final product.
Warning, finish meeting now. well, we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet. No, we can't. Yeah, we have to Yeah, it's Yes, yes. Celebration.	They did not have enough time to evaluate the project process.
we should know how many simple chips, regular chips The simple chip is e enough I I think, I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use, really. The the email I got said uh simple chip, but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device, it will uh cost a a bit more, like I think the advanced chip maybe. Maybe you can uh look it up right now. well, point out the advanced chip for now, I guess. Yeah, but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems. But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip? Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now, I've got a schematic view of the remote control, but nothing about uh advanced chips or You can look at it for s presentation. I don't think here it's in here already. Was it working design or components design? You know that a push-button requires a simple chip, but a scroll-wheel, it it me requires Okay, so we only need a simple chip. it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip, and that a display requires an advanced chip.	They were not sure what kind of chip they would need or where to find this information.
Uh, I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use, Well that's bit of a problem, because I re but I really don't understand that, because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons, and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet. it's only uh when you use push-buttons, it will cost that much. Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons. You can have f four kind of push-buttons. And plus these two, f uh plus the mute button, and it's will be uh eighteen. Why is that so uh expensive. Yeah, I don't understand. Well, okay, well well let's make it just one. I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button. Really. I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah, only with uh page up, page down and volume, Yeah, but I d I wouldn't want to own that. Really. Uh, it's it's still for little children.	They were not sure how much the buttons would cost because they seemed too expensive.
then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore, No, but you otherwise you can't retrieve it. I mean if it's a simple chip, then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents. But for two Euros and thirty cents, we uh we don't get a docking station. if it would cost two Euros, that had a total a total thing, it would be nice too, yeah, but when we skip when we um when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station, then we still yeah, we need something else maybe to make it kind of special, We can make a plain docking station for two Euros. Wi wi without recharge I think we can make a docking station. Yeah. We can make a docking station for two thirty. Yeah, but be serious, then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control. but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff. We can really can do the docking thing, Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station. No no, it's not possible.	They were not sure whether they could afford the docking station.
or we can ki do the kinetic cells. maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something. Instead of the rechargeable Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking. the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking. Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it, you know. You don't use batteries. Uh maybe it with the kinetic thing, I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing. Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote. Battery and kinetic. You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour, really. Uh, a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time. Because I think the d whole dynamic part, do you know, appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy, you know, with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing, and y when you move it around a lot, then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and Yeah, it's funny for a week. Okay, then we d Okay, well y we don't have to do it, but what that would just have a lack of key features, you know.	The project manager wanted to use kinetic energy but the others were not convinced.
But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell, because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls. So maybe we can uh use the docking station, for example, uh M_P_ three players or or uh I think that's very difficult, because of different shapes of uh uh devices. Yes, but when you put that same volt voltages on it, you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it, when it's o the same as the other products, you can put it all on the same uh The technology and the voltage can be the same. That's uh that's true. When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out, we can place all on top of it. Shouldn't it fall then? It isn't going to fall down? No, when you make it large enough no it it will not. But it's just an idea. It's leaning. It's leaning backwards, I think, in the in the docking station. Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later, because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway, because we have some uh cost issues still to come.	The could not decide whether the docking station should be adapted for use with other products.
It's something we really put work into. Yeah well, let that let's make that a one. Yeah, maybe it really depends on taste. Okay, three. I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant. I think we totally succeeded there. Well maybe a two, because of the menu button or something. Also, the the the buttons of the one, the two, the the digits, The remote control has got a really trendy look. Yeah, uh a t I think a two. we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever. But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful. You agree on the two? No, not L_C_D_, so. you mean the rubber stuff? But that that's not innovative. Or seven maybe, yeah. With the lights it it's it's kind of future Yes. The docking station is a is a little bit innovative. Well, let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what, because we have to reevaluate anyway. No uh, well, the agenda says evaluate now, so I think we how would you innovate a remote control more? Yeah, more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and But I d I definitely don't think it's a five, think about it la later on Yeah, a two. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah, a two. Yeah, you can put that on the side if if we would like to. Yeah, and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three. Yeah, make it a two.	The group were generally satisfied with the design but did not think the remote was technologically innovative.
It's a two point six. which is uh quite a great score.	The overall score was 2.6.
First of all, the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list. 'Kay, but the problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station in this list, but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents. But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore,	The group did not know how much the docking station would cost.
becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first, then you have a couple of seconds I think you should add A cross, or whatever. Yeah, line. but do we have do we need extra buttons, All n no, that's um kinda dependent on the television. Uh, there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like uh d I call it teens and twenties. No, that's dependent on the television. I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons, but you still can, know, obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten. Yes, but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television. when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash, it's the same thing as when you just push the one, some televisions don't accept uh that that When you push the button, the remote control gives a signal. and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds, then the remote control gives a signal for channel one. it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it, uh if you push a one, then on your television there will appear a one and a a line, which is an empty space. Yeah, but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button. Yes, but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button, uh then you go to a a next level, you can push two buttons. Yeah, but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point. that special but button you're talking about, eh? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash, which you can pu	The group could not agree what buttons would be needed to enter channels 10 and above.
I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire, to be honest.	The group will fill out a final questionnaire.
So we're gonna use the simple chip.	The remote will use a simple chip.
Okay, then we d Okay, well y we don't have to do it, but what that would just have a lack of key features, you know.	The remote will use a standard battery and not kinetic energy.
No no, it's not possible.	The remote will not come with a docking station.
First of all, the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list. we should know how many simple chips, regular chips The simple chip is e enough I I think, I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use, really. The the email I got said uh simple chip, but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device, it will uh cost a a bit more, like I think the advanced chip maybe. Maybe you can uh look it up right now. well, point out the advanced chip for now, I guess. Yeah, but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems. Well that's bit of a problem, Uh, I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use, because I re but I really don't understand that, because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons, and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet. it's only uh when you use push-buttons, it will cost that much. Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons. You can have f four kind of push-buttons. And plus these two, f uh plus the mute button, and it's will be uh eighteen. Why is that so uh expensive. Yeah, I don't understand. Well, okay, well well let's make it just one. I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button. Really. I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah, only with uh page up, page down and volume, Yeah, but I d I wouldn't want to own that. Really. Uh, it's it's still for little children. 'Kay, but the problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station in this list, but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents. But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore, No, but you	The group had problems figuring out the cost of the docking station and buttons, and did not know which kind of chip to use.
or we can ki do the kinetic cells. maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something. Instead of the rechargeable Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking. the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking. Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it, you know. You don't use batteries. Uh maybe it with the kinetic thing, I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing. Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote. Battery and kinetic. You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour, really. Uh, a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time. Because I think the d whole dynamic part, do you know, appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy, you know, with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing, and y when you move it around a lot, then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and Yeah, it's funny for a week. Okay, then we d Okay, well y we don't have to do it, but what that would just have a lack of key features, you know.	They discussed using kinetic energy to make the remote more technologically innovative but decided against it.
Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station. No no, it's not possible.	They eventually decided that they could not afford a docking station.
Warning, finish meeting now. well, we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet. No, we can't. Yeah, we have to Yeah, it's Yes, yes. Celebration.	They did not have time to evaluate the project process before the end of the meeting.
I received uh a spreadsheet. I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together, First of all, the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list. We include one battery. we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component, how much we need of them. we should know how many simple chips, regular chips The simple chip is e enough I I think, The the email I got said uh simple chip, but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device, it will uh cost a a bit more, like I think the advanced chip maybe. Maybe you can uh look it up right now. well, point out the advanced chip for now, I guess. Yeah, but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems. Okay, we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber. And with a special colour. Otherwise, you get uh a standard uh plastic colour. Yeah, I think we uh we have special colours. Okay, then the push-button, I was just counting them. Uh, I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use, Well that's bit of a problem, because I re but I really don't understand that, because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons, and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet. it's only uh when you use push-buttons, it will cost that much. Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons. You can have f four kind of push-buttons. And plus these two, f uh plus the mute button, and it's will be uh eighteen. Why is that so uh expensive. Yeah, I don't understand. Well, okay, well well let's make it just one. I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button. Really. I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah, only with uh page up, page down and volume, Yeah, but I d I wouldn't want to own that	The group worked out the manufacturing costs.
'Kay, we've made a prototype. especially we looked at the form, material and the colour. The logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control, I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious. did we want to have a m mute button? Alright, and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button. Yeah, but you you gotta make it clear on the on Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually. I think it's pretty basic, there's one there's one button, the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control, because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area. Then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button, which is the most common used uh function, Yes, we can make also n neon lights on it, or or the buttons that can make uh light on it.	The user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype design.
Uh the volume uh uh at the side, and the other side is the programmes. And then we had uh just uh two buttons, we place them in the middle, uh the menu, and for the teletext Uh then the the the nine uh channels. Uh, power button. we'll apply them then for now. I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary.	The remote has buttons for power, mute, teletext, volume and channel up/down, and nine numbered channel buttons.
Okay, welcome to the detailed design meeting. Oh, we're gonna have a prototype presentation first.	The project manager opened the meeting.
Yes, uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber, and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material, a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it. because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber, Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons. Uh, in the same colour as the side. But uh, and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours,	The remote is plastic with different coloured rubber strips on the sides and rubber buttons.
Right, we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points. Um, we g the four of us are going to do that um together. we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design, The remote control is not ugly. How do you feel? Yeah, maybe it really depends on taste. I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side, because you can uh make it in your own No, not not fronts, but different designs. Okay, three. The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy. Yeah well, let that let's make that a one. It's something we really put work into. The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible. Yeah, but we d we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts, I believe. I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant. The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons. I think we totally succeeded there. Well maybe a two, because of the menu button or something. Also, the the the buttons of the one, the two, the the digits, The remote control has got a really trendy look. Yeah, uh a t I think a two. we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever. But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful. You agree on the two? Remote control has got innovative technology implanted. No, not L_C_D_, so. you mean the rubber stuff? But that that's not innovative. Or seven maybe, yeah. With the lights it it's it's kind of future Yes. The docking station is a is a little bit innovative. Well, let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what, because we have to reevaluate anyway. No uh, well, the agenda says evaluate now, so I think we how would you innovate a remote control more? Yeah, more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and But I d I definitely don't think it's a five, think	The marketing expert led the product evaluation.
Uh, there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like uh d I call it teens and twenties. All n no, that's um kinda dependent on the television. but do we have do we need extra buttons, I think you should add A cross, or whatever. Yeah, line. Yeah, but you don't you don't actually need them, becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first, then you have a couple of seconds No, that's dependent on the television. I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons, but you still can, know, obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten. Yes, but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television. when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash, it's the same thing as when you just push the one, some televisions don't accept uh that that When you push the button, the remote control gives a signal. and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds, then the remote control gives a signal for channel one. it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it, uh if you push a one, then on your television there will appear a one and a a line, which is an empty space.

Yes, but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button, uh then you go to a a next level, you can push two buttons.

That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in on	The group discussed what buttons would be needed to enter channels 10 and above.
but I still think i it it all T_V_s in some ways support it, But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell, because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls. So maybe we can uh use the docking station, for example, uh M_P_ three players or or uh I think that's very difficult, because of different shapes of uh uh devices. Yes, but when you put that same volt voltages on it, you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it, when it's o the same as the other products, you can put it all on the same uh The technology and the voltage can be the same. That's uh that's true. When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out, we can place all on top of it. Shouldn't it fall then? It isn't going to fall down? No, when you make it large enough no it it will not. But it's just an idea. It's leaning. It's leaning backwards, I think, in the in the docking station. Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later, because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway, because we have some uh cost issues still to come.	They discussed adapting the docking station so it could be used with other products but did not make a decision.
So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board, We going to try it. Alright, your favourite animal? I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment. Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose, loosen up, a bit uh meeting each other We're kinda losing time, though. It's a hedgehog. and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal. It's a rabbit. save it and start a new uh These are very important documents, of course, uh these drawings, uh Yeah well we have to save everything There's also different colours and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness. It's just a bird. you choose a new colour. And a new pen width uh also format. It's a cat.	They tested it by drawing animals.
Well then uh the serious uh stuff. We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars, but uh twenty five Euros. Our profit aim is, worldwide, fifty million Euros. So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell. we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so, keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff, and uh marketing uh research. Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls, first about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera? Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls? Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not, it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls, Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then	The project manager informed the group of the budget, before beginning the discussion of current remotes and initial ideas.
I've uh made a presentation uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard, so we can all see it. Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting. So uh I'm the Project Manager, And an uh a nice agenda. Uh we'll do the opening and then uh we'll meet each other, I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here, so that we can all use them. We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project, and then uh we'll close the meeting, and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here. We have to uh design a new television remote control. Um we want it to be original, so a nice uh a nice new design. Uh trendy, it's also for young people, and we have to just uh make it uh modern. And uh friendly, so size does matter. And uh Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place, that kin those kind of things. There happen to be uh three stages. functional, conceptual, and d detailed design. Um so every time we we'll do some individual work, get meeting, talk about it, uh and then go into the next phase. We have uh these two Smartboards. Um well as I just showed, there's a project management folder, a project document folder on the desktop. It just works exactly the same as a computer. You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop. Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things, This is a uh well a drawing board. you have a these different uh functions on the board. So you have a a nice pen, and it's works just like a bal ball pen. Of course w doesn't work any more. We can uh uh well you can save a file. So if	After introducing the remote control objective, the project manager demonstrated the SmartBoard technology they would be using.
so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera. Well it's just uh about our first ideas now	Individual must come up with their ideas for the next meeting.
Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea? Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes.	They will look further at the idea of covers in the mext meeting too.
Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be, but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote.	The interface specialist will look at button and over all look.
It has to be different and familiar at the same time. we could use another form or shape or colour, that kind of things. I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped, but that's not uh very recognisable. Well we we could make more more oval or something, and and N we can use uh it as a as a game pad. So one hand has the beer, so the other hand uh but young people want something different Yeah but it's quite important that it fits. one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh, yeah, useful for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them. When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here. It shouldn't be boxy. I don't agree with the long box uh shape But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this, and you can make it another shape, No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped. No that's ol old fashioned. Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end, and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end. uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand, A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand. It shouldn't be too boxy, you know. but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also	The considered options for the shape of the remote control, imagining how it would fit in the hand.
Well it's just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera.	Specific ideas as to components and materials are to be left to the next meeting.
Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them, and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs That's kinda trendy. Sound nice. Yes. I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um Well it's just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera. I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make, You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh. I think. So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over. Yeah now we can still talk about the material, I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course, hard plastic, the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh. Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy. Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea? Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes. and you can always use a front front on it, you know? You can use it just plain but you can To make it more trendy. And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh Well you can make profit with them, and it's a way to make them trendy. Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell, so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so But people of often don't like bright colours	The group ended the discussion by touching very briefly on some materials issues, and discussed remote covers.
I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors. Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control. On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce. Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use, we uh we make? and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player. And stereo uh s uh audio installations. And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes. because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design	They considered taking the best of their competitors designs and making a multifunction remote.
Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world, for different cultures, maybe, because we want to we want to well fifty million? No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh and numbers and uh that every culture in uh, yeah, people in every country can recognise. I also think we should not add too many buttons. Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think. Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something. so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh	It needs to be useable internationally, with few buttons.
and uh and that the less important uh buttons, like the the the different channels, uh the numbers one two three four five as well, should be uh yeah well not in reach, We have a power button, setting buttons, L_C_D_ window, the number buttons Channel, yeah. Volume control. Uh the mute button. Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button, for your menu. Menu button. Yeah. I think that's important.	Other functions are served by push buttons: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down with the last three types being prominent on the device.
and the design comes into the next round?	The exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting.
uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly, So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that, I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best.	The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons.
And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information. No not clickable. Uh well I think so, yes. Um Alright, we go with the L_C_D_ screen?	They plan to include an LCD screen to display relevant information.
Furthermore, it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot. A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room. Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn.	Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose.
And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip, The chip uh produces Morse code, um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed, of course. Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the, well it's uh very simple, and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set,	The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.
because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years.	The target group will be people below 30.
They also say, that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent, uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls. Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device. And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition. They also like that,	It transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes, especially if they include LCD screens and speech recognition.
But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section. Th that's a bit uh waste. I do think we have to put that underneath a clip.	The less frequently used buttons will not be hidden under a flip, as it had been previously suggested, as there are not that many of them; they will just be clearly separated from the more important ones.
But I think it's very important to make um the power, channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb, so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences. but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_. That's very irritating, I think. Yeah, but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true. I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button? Yeah, in circle, you know? So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other. Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place. So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart, I think, up and down. No I don't think. I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together, but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together.	A discussion on ergonomic solutions like placing the main buttons (power, channel selection, volume) where they can be easily reached with the thumb (as many users complain of RSI), did not reach a conclusion as to whether this would actually cause more repetitive movements.
So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that, uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly, I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best.	The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons.
Um now the new project requirements, I'll just show them. Well, teletext goes out. and they don't want it, Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products.	There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.
And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information. No not clickable. Alright, we go with the L_C_D_ screen? Uh well I think so, yes. Um	An LCD screen is going to be used to display information, but would not be interactive.
We have a power button, setting buttons, L_C_D_ window, the number buttons Channel, yeah. Volume control. Uh the mute button. Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button, for your menu. Menu button. Yeah. I think that's important.	The buttons are going to include: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down.
Alright so no button for that. Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital?	There is no need for a special button to recognise two-digit numbers.
Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device. It's going to be expensive. Yeah. I don't have any information on that. So I think that's uh difficult to realise also. And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition. Um, research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features. Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition. Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost.	Some advanced features, like LCD screen with program information or speech recognition, would be very important in order to attract their target group, but there are costing issues that have not been clarified yet.
I think it should be at the top. Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural. because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom. We don't want them to look like a calculator. I think it's still important to have it at the top,	There was some disagreement as to whether the LCD screen should be placed at the top or the bottom of the remote.
and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think. So	Each member of the team will come for the next meeting with their views on function and design issues that they had not time to consolidate during this meeting.
So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design. So you can pick up and use it, than I think.	The solution to complaints about remote controls being difficult to learn is to focus on an intuitive design instead of a thorough manual.
But I think it's very important to make um the power, channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb, so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences. but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_. That's very irritating, I think. I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button? Yeah, in circle, you know? Yeah, but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true. So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other. Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place. So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart, I think, up and down. No I don't think. I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together, but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together.	No consensus was reached regarding the positioning of the main buttons (zapping, volume, power) either: should they be placed close together or more scattered (to avoid RSI complaints)?
I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front. but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company.	The idea of interchangeable fronts was mentioned again; if it were adopted, the company should be recognisable in all the available fronts as well as the remote itself.
And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video. Yeah, but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh	A special AV button for direct access to the video channel, although its necessity was disputed, because there are alternative solutions that make it obsolete.
Can you draw it now?	The team drew a provisional prototype.
And then below is the L_C_D_ screen? Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course? Yeah, fine. And oh I think as you can see so, the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end, or at the bottom.	They placed the LCD below the buttons.
But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part. if we decide to uh to implement that, maybe we should. Well the speaker and the microphone, I think, are the same uh little hole thingy.	If it is implemented, a recording button, microphone and speaker need to be included in the design.
Uh furthermore uh material, that's your part, should be very strong. I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it,	Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front.
Uh the buttons of course rubber, uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery. But solar energy is not very practical inside a house, And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical, I think, for uh for a simple remote, Um f as uh for the buttons, simple push buttons. No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that, so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip,	The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel), simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo), and advanced chip.
Um it's not really speech recognition, and then once you uh talk to the remote, then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left. No it doesn't does not do anything.	Speech recognition can be implemented, but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions.
Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours. And also they like curved round shapes.	He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours, soft textures and curved shapes.
and then once you uh talk to the remote, then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left. Um it's not really speech recognition, No it doesn't does not do anything.	The version of speech recognition discussed does not link voice commands to actual device actions.
When you want an other colour on the front, it doesn't match. and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front. but you know b Titanium is very basic colour,	Changing the front colours may make the front clash with the titanium, but it was also thought neutral enough for it not to matter.
Well yeah. Um I think um a logo, our company logo, and the slogan should be or could be Uh I I'd say only the logo. Well, our slogan is not very long. But you can put it on the back, Ah the logo should be on the top I think. Right corner, yes. Yes, slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front	They wondered whether to use both the logo and the slogan on the device and where it would be best for them to be placed.
Well a case? Uh that's me. Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium, And then the front is made of plastic. Titanium back, plastic front. Okay. Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers? Yeah. Round.	The case will be titanium with a plastic front with rounded buttons.
So uh a little corner of titanium.	Parts of the front (like the bottom where the LCD is and the top corner where the logo is) will also be titanium.
all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work.	The chip is going to be a standard one.
I think we can launch a couple of packages. Launch different lines at once. Yeah but you you can have some basic colours,	They will launch the product with various fronts to choose from including a couple of basic colours or fruit and vegetable themes to go with the current fashion.
But you can put it on the back, Ah the logo should be on the top I think. Right corner, yes. Yes, slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front	The logo will be both at the front and the back of the remote; the company slogan will be engraved at the back.
Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said,	The team found a possible conflict between the need for strong materials and the customers' preference for soft textures.
Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough, but it doesn't have a really really tough look. So But the feel of plastic isn't strong.	Plastic may be strong, but it does not necessarily look it.
Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year. Yeah, that's great.	Making changeable fascias can allow for the integration of this or future fashion trends in the device.
Well, as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote. Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course? And then below is the L_C_D_ screen? And oh I think as you can see so, the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end, or at the bottom. Yeah, fine.	The team agreed to place the LCD at the bottom of the device, below the buttons.
Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff	TV settings will be included in menus there instead of having separate buttons for them.
Maybe a a cheap voice recording. We all agree on that. Yeah.	They will implement speech recognition as well, because their target group like such gimmicks.
It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling. Um, technological technological innovations, that's uh regarded very highly too. Uh the last point is easy to use.	For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use.
Well a case? Uh that's me. Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium, And then the front is made of plastic. Titanium back, plastic front. Okay.	Finally, they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved.
So it must be very bright, very colourful. Fruit and vegetables are cool. Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year.	The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote.
I think we can launch a couple of packages. Launch different lines at once.	Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched.
Industry designer,. User Interface, Mike. You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard.	The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype, where they will also sort out the details about the buttons.
Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means,	The marketing expert will carry out an evaluation of the product.
Uh the buttons of course rubber, I think everyone agrees.	The push buttons are going to be made of rubber.
so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip, But we do use an L_C_D_ screen,	The chip needs to be an advanced one to be compatible with the LCD screen that is going to be incorporated in the design.
And of course this low part, this is the L_C_D_ screen.	The LCD can be found at the lower section of the device.
I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation.	After the presentation, the product was evaluated.
uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back, part of the titanium uh titanium part. And we thought about the logo big in the middle. And the company slogan, we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo.	The back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle.
I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons. the the con the the the, yeah, the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here. Um um with kind of arrow shapes, And the video button. Menu for the L_C_D_ screen.	The buttons include oval digit buttons, arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle; below those, is the menu (for the LCD) and the video button.
That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria. Uh the first question is, uh is the device good-looking? Easy to change channels? The uh device is easy to find if you lose it? Are there enough technology? Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented? Is the material attractive?	This was done on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) on fancifulness, ease of use, finding the device when it is lost, hi-tech features, incorporation of fashion trends, and ergonomic design.
look at the costs at this point. The sample speaker, Kick it out. So we have to use the ditch the titanium, I'm afraid.	Because it was over budget, titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded.
Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium, Th then you have a ugly, stupid, l ugly looking, dumb remote that that no-one would buy.	Replacing the titanium with plastic would have a detrimental effect on the looks of the remote.
Yeah, we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen. But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen. Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen, it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing.	The only way was to go to a regular chip, but that would mean losing the LCD screen, which was integral to the design.
The sample speaker, Kick it out.	The sample speaker was taken out to bring the cost of the prototype down to the original budget of 12.50 euros.
And of course this low part, this is the L_C_D_ screen. Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side, but Well f for as far as I can see, three of us agree and only Nils So let it be like this at uh at this moment.	Despite disagreement regarding the position of the LCD (top or bottom), the screen was left at the bottom as it was in the prototype.
Uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing.	Some people thought that there was no advantage to using the SMARTboard instead of a normal blackboard and chalk, although you can save and reuse things with the former.
Uh well what do you, what did you think about the SMARTboard? It was a complete disaster.	The SMARTboard was considered a disaster as they could not draw, and the digital pens can only be useful for drawings.
Well we make it more expensive to buy. Well, then we have two dollars less profit. I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days.	The team discussed the possibility to leave the remaining cost at 14.10.
but now we're going to evaluate our project, of uh project, are we satisfactory about our creativity? Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best, yeah. Uh leadership Well it's It was very democratic. Well the managers were terrible. So, with their all their useless requirements. teamwork? Well great I think. Uh well what do you, what did you think about the SMARTboard? It was a complete disaster. And uh the digi the digital pen? Yeah, it might be useful for drawings. I I agree on that.	Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (generally satisfied), leadership (the process was democratic, not happy with management), teamwork (happy with it), and means (SMARTboard was 'a disaster' and the digital pens only good for drawings).
Kick it out. Then we go to fourteen point six. The sample speaker,	The total cost of the prototype was 18.6 euros.
and only Nils Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side, but	The project manager still disagreed on the position of the LCD: he would prefer it to be at the top.
If if you look if if this this is thick, and this is thin, th th then it that it lies over your hands. But	There was criticism for the shape of the remote (thicker at the ends, thinner at the middle).
So we have to use the ditch the titanium, I'm afraid.	They also decided to replace titanium with similar-looking plastic for the same reason.
We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape. Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic, the front. And uh we're we're using different colours.	It is rounded, with the front made of hard plastic in different colours.
and the rest of it, the under uh the under side uh of it, yeah, the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium,	The back, as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium.
this is our design.	The ID and UI presented the drawing of a prototype.
The first kick-off meeting. First the opening, then the rest. We m have to make a new remote control. It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly. So we will get back th on that. First we have to make a functional design. After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design. So we'll discuss that later.	For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings.
For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it. So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control? The weight. Not not too heavy. Not much buttons. That when you drop it, it won't break. Like uh some kind of rubber on it. Or hard uh hard plastic. Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen. Uh it between the couch and you can't find it. When you push a but a button on the T_V_, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep. Yeah well that's that are good ideas. Uh And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material. So probably plastic or something. Uh Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice. on our website we can see what products we already have. And it should work with as many uh as possible of them. Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries. So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.	They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote.
The weight. Not not too heavy. Not much buttons. That when you drop it, it won't break. Like uh some kind of rubber on it. Or hard uh hard plastic. Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen. Uh it between the couch and you can't find it. When you push a but a button on the T_V_, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep. And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material. So probably plastic or something. Uh Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice. on our website we can see what products we already have. And it should work with as many uh as possible of them. Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries. So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.	They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.
So first to we have to make a small painting. First you can save the documents. We have to do that every time we make something. And we have to use the pen and the eraser. We all have to use this one. So I'll make an example. Um you can change some things. Um format, line, and change it. And you can change the colour. So and after it you have to save it. An elephant. So you're next. Uh a bird. Now save? Okay.	The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform.
First I wanna hear from you. Uh what are your experiences with remote controls. Big one, they are uh not easy to use. And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think. Big buttons, positive. Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set. And that it controls the channels and the the volume. And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote. And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working. But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that. Uh at home we have a T_V_, a video uh recorder, a D_V_D_ player, and a satellite receiver. We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that. That's not really ea easy. So it would be nice if we have one for all.	They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators.
If we aim for the younger people, um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising, uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher. Uh I think we don't have that in our budget. And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something. So it's Yeah, it's hard to uh get the younger group. I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition. Uh we go back on the decisions later. So I think that can be an d good option. L_C_D_.	The group then discussed their target group ,and what features they might include to attract them.
Then it's your turn, the marketing expert. So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market, Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons. And we looked at uh several um things. Uh among them design, uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls. Uh our users, they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls. Um uh they especially found found them very ugly. And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it. Uh well they also zap a lot. And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons. So a lot of unused buttons. Well uh the most used button is the channel selection. The power, volume and channel selections are very relevant. Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important. Uh not important they found the audio, uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch, or the left or right. Uh the screen and the brightness. And uh channel settings. Uh th and they also are not used very often. Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups. Then we have a few um graphs about the market. Um as you can see, most users are uh between thirty six and forty five. Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big. And to come back on the the swapping uh things, uh I don't think uh, I I think the younger will be most interest in it. Um in the we asked them, uh how would you like a s a new feature. If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control, what would you think of it. Now you can clearly see young users say. I will that would very nice. And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think. And another thing, how would you like to have a speech recognition on it. Young users uh think that's an interesting idea. And old users not. Uh well we	The Marketing Expert present the findings of the usability study.
Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design. Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set. And uh well, it all by pushing a button on the remote. Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web. Uh message to the television. And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off, and uh switching channels, and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that. well these are two uh remotes, and that's our uh our dilemma I think. Uh But uh shall we make a basic remote control, uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more. Or uh uh more functions on the remote. Uh maybe more devices you can influence. Uh a radio or a v a video recorder, uh V_C_R_. Um any ideas about that? Basic or multifunctional? We'll got back on that later. So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go.	The User Interface Designer very briefly mentioned some features a remote should have and suggested it should be multifunctional.
And I just uh have one more idea. But Uh, to have a trendy remote control, we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones. To change covers. So if you have uh a trendy half with all red, uh yellow and something. And then you can put a red cover on it. Will this will this add to the cost? Uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one. And then you can buy the covers. but you have to m uh be able to change it. D does it make it more difficult to design? I think it will be a little more difficult, but not too much. Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones. Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones. If it won't works then we'll get something else. Then we uh won't g uh go further with it. Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost? Uh a p a a cover made in uh in China, it it won't be I guess so expensive I think. Yeah but there are also design cost. Would you change the cover? I wi I won't. But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it, I think that too less people would change it for good profit. So I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea. but I don't think we have to do it.	He also suggested mobile phone-like changeable covers, and the group discussed the profit in this.
So first I wanna ask the Industrial Designer to tell what he did. So It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you. It's about the working of the remote control. I just had an half an hour j to study it and I don't get it. First uh I will tell you something about the findings, what I discovered about the remote control. Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map, and it's the top of the remote control. The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside. Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it, um because its uh not so expensive. And there are uh a lot of uh wires, uh which um connect the components in it, and there are um switches and things like that. There's a lot of small uh electronics. So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it. Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it. And here I have the top of the remote control. Uh here's some kind of chip. Uh on top of this, there are uh the numbers. Uh you have all on your remote control. And uh the teletext uh button. And uh here's the battery. And when you push the button, it will uh will be sent to the chip. And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components. My preferences? We shouldn't make it too big. Uh also for the cost, uh we should only put one battery on it. A long-lasting battery. Uh also for the cost, uh use only plastic. Also because of the cost, uh not too much buttons on it. We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button. And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_. And the bleep signal, y uh you told us. Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something, when the battery's empty, then there is a	The Industrial Designer briefly explained the internal workings of the remote,  and mentioned his preferences for power source and case material.
So welcome back. first. I want to say I'm the secretary, so I make the minutes. You find them in your in the map in the From the group. There's the minutes from the first meeting. You'll find the next minutes also there.	The project manager opened the meeting by explaining how to locate his minutes from the previous meeting.
Uh the well um I think separate channels. So So so uh zero to nine or something. Uh volume. To move up, move down. Uh yes Do we make a menu? I think it will be um q quite easy to use, to have uh uh four arrows. Up-down for channel selection, and left-right uh for volume. And if you press the menu button you get into the menu, Mute.	The buttons will consist of number, a menu button, arrows for changing channel and volume, but also navigating the menu, and a mute button.
And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like? Or that's for the next phase. I think that's enough for the next phase. Phase two is the conceptual design.	The design of the remote control is to be carried out at the next meeting.
Your individual action, you can find them in the email.	Individual actions for the next meeeting can be found in emails to be sent.
Now we have to decide what controls do we need. Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said. Well a power button? Uh the well um I think separate channels. So So so uh zero to nine or something. Uh volume. To move up, move down. Do we make a menu? Uh yes I think it will be um q quite easy to use, to have uh uh four arrows. Up-down for channel selection, and left-right uh for volume. And if you press the menu button you get into the menu, On the L_C_D_ screen, you mean? Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_. Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control. Think it's better to have it on the remote control, But then we come to the costs. But well if you aim at the younger market, um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab, uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control. So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen, and uh not too many buttons, I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost, it will still sell. Is this enough? Mute.	The group then discussed what buttons they might need, which included menu, numbers, channel and volume changing arrows and mute.
Now we have a few new product requirements. First, teletext. We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore. So not necessary. Only for the television. So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something. We look at the age group of forty plus. Uh no, younger than forty. Our corporate colour and slogan must be used. So you can see it on our site. I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option. It's a new requirement. Yeah but we don't use it. No discussion about it.	The manager introduced new requirements to the project, insisting they were to be followed.
And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger. It's not good to use.	Whether to have a trigger-shaped power button.
but like we said before, it has to be used on every television. but l when you see a menu uh on the television, it's like you see uh one to twenty, you go uh uh s scroll up, and push number tw twenty. Yeah, I think the younger people will have newer televisions, which can provide our uh remote control. But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu. Uh, then we have it on the T_V_, the menu. Yeah, but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it?	If they can use a menu on the TV screen if the remote does not have an LCD.
Personally, I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle. Uh, then you can also have like uh th um Yeah, and joystick, I think. Or a small one just like in a laptop. Does that break, a joystick? But how expensive it is? For the young peoples I think scroll button's good. That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better. Maybe, if it's possible, it's not too expensive, I think a joystick is better.	Whether to use a joystick rather than a scroll button to navigate the menu.
Now we put uh rubber around it. Hard plastic, uh the shape, and around it hard uh around it rubber.	The case will be made of hard plastic and rubber.
Then for the components, we use a normal battery. Then it's Ch cheapest way, I think.	The remote will use a normal battery.
Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_. Uh, can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without? I got it on my screen and it was uh higher. But I don't know uh how much higher. The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip. So, depends on the cost.	There was a lack of information about the cost of an LCD screen.
But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons. And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news. I think if we have an L_C_D_, it will also sell a lot better. And that might uh bring back the costs uh And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it, then the costs will uh be much higher.	Whether to use an LCD screen or not.
Uh the push-buttons. We have one new thing uh discovered. It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse. Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels. When you want to go m move up, you just scroll up and click on the button, if you wanna see the next, uh if you wanna see that channel. You can do it with your thumb. And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons The electrics um with a scroll push uh button, we must use regular uh chips. There are also uh simple chips. They are uh cheaper. Um, but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control, And you have also advanced um chips. But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen. And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_, Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip. A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip, which is a higher price range. The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip.	He talked about the possibility of using a scroll button, and the different chips which could be used.
This is with an L_C_D_? No, But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel. And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news. but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls. And I think, what I said, everybody has them uh has them already. I got it on my screen and it was uh higher. And that might uh bring back the costs uh I think we must discuss who uh what will be better. If we have a better shape of the um remote control, or better options on it. With a scroll menu, a w scroll thing, and a L_C_D_. And then a flat um remote control. Or, a more hand-shaped remote control, with scroll, without L_C_D_. Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_. Not with an L_C_D_. But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons. but l when you see a menu uh on the television, it's like you see uh one to twenty, you go uh uh s scroll up, and push number tw twenty. but like we said before, it has to be used on every television. Yeah, I think the younger people will have newer televisions, which can provide our uh remote control. Uh, can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without? But I don't know uh how much higher. I think if we have an L_C_D_, it will also sell a lot better. The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip.	The group discussed using an LCD screen, but did not have enough information about costs to make a decision.
So, my uh presentation is about trend-watching. Uh, well we made an investigation of the market, by Trendwatchers. They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan. Uh, we have two groups, young and trendy, and the old and rich. Well th and the young and trendy, they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes, shoes, and also uh products. And um, material? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling. Then the old and rich. They like uh dark colours, and simple, recognisable shapes. We uh aim at the younger market. Well, uh then already come to my personal preferences. However, with trends it's always if there's it's now. It it it might last one year, and next year it be uh can be totally different.	The marketing expert talked about new trends, including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products.
Well, we have to decide on the concept. Maybe one of you can paint it on the board. Can make several uh concepts. We have this, and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand. This is the remote control. And then you have something like th this under it. So, it has to be soft? And it has to be soft, yeah. Buttons on top of it. The scrolling. You can do it with your thumb. But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here. If we have a menu, uh how do we uh choose other options? with the menu uh button. And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it. But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu. Uh, then we have it on the T_V_, the menu. Yeah, but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it? And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it, then the costs will uh be much higher. we make two concepts. One with L_C_D_. One without L_C_D_. And and this one has to be soft. And this has to be harder, And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger. It's not good to use. Or some kind of rubber around it. One with two scroll buttons and one with without. Uh, one with a with a menu, and one without a menu. And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_. Yes, but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose. Then it depends on the cost. M uh yeah, maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um more separate, yeah. Like, you have the menu button in between uh I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for. When you uh the menu, you have to go there there there there. We have two buttons missing. The mute button. Mute. And the other. Personally, I think	The group had a discussion and decided to create two designs, one with an LCD screen and one without, and the interface designer drew them on the board.
let's uh talk about the interface uh concept. Uh, first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose, uh show you some samples, uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe, already. And uh my personal preferences. Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off. the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off. The channels buttons, one to nine, zero to nine, and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine. Uh the volume and channel quadrants, uh left and right, up and down arrows, to uh do the volume and channel. And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display. Um, I found some uh interesting uh uh samples. Examples. Um, well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh Large. A lot a lot of buttons buttons. Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long. Um, power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right. Yeah, well arrow b buttons can be blue. And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons. Some buttons have icons like the play and stop, but we don't use that. But uh, these we we have to choose the right icons, or or letters. Uh this is the V_ for volume, but they're both uh a V_. So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that. For the uh menu, what do we use for that? We don't have buttons for the menu. Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel. I thought that was our uh idea. And that the menu button is okay. Yeah but, has to be clear that you can use the arrows. The icons on the arrows, as well, you mean.	The industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept, discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls.
Um, well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already, or in the next uh meeting. But uh, as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo, I would uh recommend a yellow case. Uh, round edges. The logo at the bottom. And uh, well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour. Uh, recognisable. Not too much colours. Uh, no. Not too much. But this has to be has to be trendy Uh, yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons, and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion.	He suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom, and large, clearly marked buttons.
Uh, at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want, our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to. And then, I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs, about uh what battery is in it, what kind of buttons also. First uh, the younger people, they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours. Like, totally yellow, totally red. Uh, the shapes are curved and round, Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones, straight and uh flat and long. But to give him the shape of your hand, so you it's easier to use or something like that. The battery, there are few options. Uh, I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery. Uh, the the form of the remote control, I think it's also nice have it curved. And maybe like it's hand-shaped. Uh material, you use plastic. Hard plastic And also rubber And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control, that we then use the primary colours.	The interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes, soft materials and primary colours, and suggested making a hand-shaped remote in plastic and rubber.
You two stay here. It has to be ready in the next meeting.	The industrial designer and user interface designer will stay in the room to design the prototypes.
Uh, I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery. Chip. Depends on the L_C_D_. If we use a scroll, then we have the uh regular chip. If we don't use a scroll, then we can use the simple chip. And uh, we If you use the L_C_D_, we have to Uh the most expensive. So, uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing? If you have pistol, it L_C_D_'s not easy. if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller. Then this is the design. And the buttons are on the next page. So, depends on the cost. And on the L_C_D_, how much it costs? they're not uh in details. It's more expensive or less expensive, huh? So, after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it.	They put off making a final decision about using an LCD screen, scroll buttons and a menu button until they could find out about costs.
Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_.	The interface designer will find out how much an LCD screen will cost.
well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel, it's okay. 'Cause we can't lose the battery. We can't lose the advanced chip. We can't lose the double curve. We have rubber, special colour. Uh, I don't think it's a very special colour. Yellow? Uh, is it a special colour? For a remote control, I think it is. If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick. For up down left right. Um, then we uh lose two Euros. Then we have thirteen Euros. Half a Euro too much. Exactly the special colours. Um just only plastic or only rubber? One Euro discount. I think we have to keep the L_C_D_. And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour Normal colour, and the the joystick away, Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television. If we lose the L_C_D_, then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_. And then uh we move the the colour. No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour. So, all the buttons has to have to be the same colour. And you cannot use the red and green button.	Which features should be removed or changed.
But if you lose the joystick, it's still uh an advanced chip? Or it's then a regular? The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ If we lose the L_C_D_, then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_.	Which chip would be needed for the revised design.
Now, the finance. Do we change the the order? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first? Finance is um first uh Yes. We have to evaluate the product yet. Sorry.	There was some confusion about the agenda.
It's too expensive. Fifteen Euros. So, we have to change something.	The production costs of the initial design came to fifteen Euros, so the design had to be changed.
Now, uh project eva evaluation. process. Went good. I think uh the creativity uh was good enough. Uh leadership. Yeah, you were the project project manager, and uh had the final vote. Team-work okay. New ideas found. Nope. I I espe I especially uh liked the the means, the the SMARTboard Yeah, I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices. Well, the laptops if you have them out front of you, you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation. Um, well uh the draw-board, well you can draw things. But it not really going very convenient. Uh, maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor Um, and uh the project. Yeah, I agree on what was said uh mainly. Uh, yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others. And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking. I think it was good. Not too many discussions. So, it's good for the speed. So, I think we're ready. Good price. Evaluation ready.	Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting.
well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel, it's okay. 'Cause we can't lose the battery. We can't lose the advanced chip. We can't lose the double curve. We have rubber, special colour. Uh, I don't think it's a very special colour. Yellow? Uh, is it a special colour? For a remote control, I think it is. If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick. For up down left right. Um, then we uh lose two Euros. Then we have thirteen Euros. Half a Euro too much. Exactly the special colours. Um just only plastic or only rubber? One Euro discount. I think we have to keep the L_C_D_. And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour Normal colour, and the the joystick away, But if you lose the joystick, it's still uh an advanced chip? Or it's then a regular? The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ If we lose the L_C_D_, then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_. Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television. And then uh we move the the colour. No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour. And you cannot use the red and green button. So, all the buttons has to have to be the same colour. What's the normal colour? Very good.	The group discussed how to make the design cheaper, and decided to keep the LCD screen, but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons.
Next. Finance. So, now uh we have a product. But uh, is it cheap enough? We have a battery. Cheapest there is. Electronics. Advanced chip. it's the most advanced. We have the simple, regular and advanced. We have the adva advanced. We have double curved. we have half rubber, half plastic. Special colour. Yes, yellow. So, we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels? Or one? One. And it's not really a s Joystick uh thing. Now, uh button supplement. Special colour. The buttons are regular colour. It's too expensive. Fifteen Euros. So, we have to change something.	The project manager calculated the production costs, which were too high at fifteen Euros.
Two. So um, come back to the presentation now. So, we find yourself there, and now we have to calculate an average rating. Effort is three, ten and twelve. Thirty, forty, fifty,. Twenty one. So, it's uh two and three nine two and one third. So uh, that's a pretty low rating, I think. So, it's good. So, according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job.	The overall rating was two.
Um, we gonna do the evaluation now, together. I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias, uh based on um our marketing strategy, on uh the latest trends, on user preferences. Uh, we have a seven point scale from uh true, as well. To false, seven? And on base of each c uh criteria, we need to um give a rating. Um, well uh we have the Word document Uh, what this just an example. So, this not very important. But um, if I can get a number in here. Um, so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative. Uh, and then we have to uh agree on the rating together. And in the end, we will c uh count an average of all rating. Yeah, I think it's uh Uh, well technologically using, it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features. Um, I think I will give it a yeah, yeah, yeah, a four. I think the scroll-button is something also uh new. I think technologically I'll give it an seven. So now i I think you uh see it um its statement. And you true or false. Oh, true or false. Oh, uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two. Two. It's a one. The first item. Um, this product is for all sorts of customers. Well, it's a statement which uh I disagree with, because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow, it's not uh really aimed for all customers. That's uh a six. Mm, four. So I think it's four. I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons. Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours. We put the fashion in electronics. Yeah, well do we do this with uh this product? I think if we do this, as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design. Um, so I would give it a two. Me too a two	Led by the marketing expert, the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven, based on a set of evaluation criteria.
Now uh, I ask you to presentate the prototype. This is it. It's uh it's uh it's yellow. And uh, this is rubber. And and and this too. And the rest is hard plastic. the sides. We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside. And then it covers the these buttons And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick. So, you can still operate uh all the things. Because you don't always use the menu. And the buttons? Big buttons. And everything is blue, except the power button. yeah, and the mute and the the other button. And the joystick is for the volume and the channels. Very obvious. Up is channel up. Down is channel down. To the right is volume up. To the left is volume down. Okay, so if joystick and L_C_D_. What's the R_R_ R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo. That's on the rub rubber part. So, what they say on the side is put fashion there. So, that's it. That's prototype.	The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design, made of yellow rubber and hard plastic, with large, mostly blue buttons, a joystick and LCD screen.
If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick. For up down left right. Normal colour, and the the joystick away, No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour.	The remote will have regular push-buttons instead of a joystick.
Uh, I don't think it's a very special colour. And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour Normal colour, and the the joystick away, And then uh we move the the colour. No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour.	The remote will be a normal colour rather than a special colour.
I think we have to keep the L_C_D_.	The remote will have an LCD screen.
process. Went good. I think uh the creativity uh was good enough. Uh leadership. Yeah, you were the project project manager, and uh had the final vote. Team-work okay. New ideas found. Nope. I I espe I especially uh liked the the means, the the SMARTboard Yeah, I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices. Well, the laptops if you have them out front of you, you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation. Um, well uh the draw-board, well you can draw things. But it not really going very convenient. Uh, maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor Um, and uh the project. Yeah, I agree on what was said uh mainly. Uh, yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others. And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking. I think it was good. Not too many discussions. So, it's good for the speed.	Overall, the group were satisfied with the creativity, teamwork and available equipment, although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful.
or your personal coach will probably email you about th it.	They will receive information from their personal coaches.
Um and first of all it should be original, it should be trendy and user-friendly. it's a remote control, this new product we are are g are going to develop, um	The group will design a trendy, original and user-friendly remote control.
the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros. Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros,	The remote control will be sold for 25 euros with a profit aim of 50 million euros.
we uh we will focus this internationally,	The remote will be sold internationally.
Yes, but there's a cost limitation too. So that's a big problem, I think. I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product. The cost price is very low.	It was felt that the low production costs would not allow them to create a trendy high-end product.
maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or But then Bluetooth uh might be problem. It's use uh a lot of uh Well does it? I know it from the cell phone. Well, cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and, well, it's it seems to work uh quite okay. But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time, twenty four hours a day.	Whether using glow in the dark buttons and bluetooth would mean that the remote consumes too much energy.
Okay. Gentlemen, I'm afraid we do not have any more time. so we will go back to our own uh work. Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um, well, you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it. See you in thirty minutes.	The project manager closed the meeting.
so we will go back to our own uh work. and um, well, you know your o your individual actions	Each member of the group will work on their individual tasks.
And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this? Or are there any o other controls? Yeah, or maybe you want a touch-screen or I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward, sidewords. And um it's very easy for a user to to switch to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_, And for other user interface I had um, well, it's more industrial thing. Uh point at a T_V_, I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_, so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that. so you must point everywhere, Maybe not even pointed. So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited. For T_V_, you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_, so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that, but if you want to uh get it working with a radio, and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker, then maybe the range should be uh You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons, so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand. And of course you don't always know where all buttons are, so it should be visible al um in dark too. Uh I'll write down glow in the dark. But uh lots of devices already use infrared. And uh, yeah, infrared might be an issue. we'll probably have to implement that. Um you said something about visibility in the dark. uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control, on which you can see functions? but it it can be quite simple, you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it. The uh the the digits in	They also discussed having glow in the dark buttons, using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and/or a joystick instead of conventional buttons.
because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product. Yes, but there's a cost limitation too. So that's a big problem, I think. twelve Euro fifty, yeah. I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product. The cost price is very low.	However, they were unsure about what the budget would allow.
Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily um or it should not consume too much um power. Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week. maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or But then Bluetooth uh might be problem. It's use uh a lot of uh Well does it? I know it from the cell phone. Well, cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and, well, it's it seems to work uh quite okay. But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time, twenty four hours a day.	The project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power, but this might be difficult if using bluetooth.
the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros. Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros, we uh we will focus this internationally, And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty,	The project manager then went over the project budget.
And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty,	The production costs should be no more than 12.50 euros.
maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation. Yes, um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion, I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things, and the technical possibilities and impossibilities. So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas, uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions, but uh there might be some impossibilities. Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available I have some uh initial ideas about some things One thing about uh interopera operability. Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment. Uh for instance, uh D_V_D_ players, cell phones, video and audio equipment. Well, there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them. Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other. We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore, so infrared is not uh is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore. But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth. Yeah, but the infrared, it's uh, well, a little bit old-fashioned, if you would call it like that. But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared, so you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote. but that's uh something we should discuss but take these things into account when you start the discussion.	The industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project, suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared.
um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different devices?	The remote will control multiple devices.
Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things. Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications. Um there are other things like um how to make it trendy, which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role. Um the way how it should be controlled by the user, which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part. H how do you think the remote should um function for the user? Okay, um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting. Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product? Uh I think most most things have already been said, And uh, yeah, infrared might be an issue. like uh control multiple devices.	The project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas.
Yes, I think it should be something like that. I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store. we're just developing this product, and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public,	The remote will be sold directly to individual consumers rather than companies.
Um well, the interoperability, just like uh Sebastian said, um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different devices?	The user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices.
I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store. Yes, I think it should be something like that. It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product, right? Okay, so we're we're going business to consumer, Yeah, I do I don't know that. We're not developing this product for a specific vendor, are we? don't have the information for it.	The group were unsure about whether they would be selling their product directly to consumers or to electronics manufacturers.
Okay, the waiting is for our Marketing Expert, Ruud. Is there a schedule for this meeting? Yes, there is actually. Um I will li list the agenda for today. For this meeting. It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square, um for the cameras. Um we're here to develop uh a new product. this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it. Um you are here in a specific role. Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert, Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer. we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here. Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan, uh and we will have a discussion. Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes, Um is there any room for a little presentation? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section? No problem. this new product we are are g are going to develop, um it's a remote control, Um and first of all it should be original, it should be trendy and user-friendly. Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things. Um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development, Uh the functional design, the conceptual design and the detailed design, um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work, prepare, and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the Um the first stage, the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements, Um the second is the technical functional design, um what effect should the remote have? Um and the last one is the working design. How exactly does it work in the technical	The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, describing what the project would involve, the role of each participant and the agenda for the first meeting.
Okay, um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here. You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to. to um presentate, to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder, Um then we have this electronic white-board system. you can draw on the board using this pen. There are little um uh sensors, it's on the um eraser now, so we click the pen button. you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button. Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file. So do not m make a new file. But we all use the same white-board file Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour. Current colour, you can choose another colour. I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected. Uh a wee rabbit. Um Roo, could you do the same please? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width. It it should be a cat. Okay, so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to.	He the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using, and the group practiced using the SMARTboard by drawing their favourite animals.
And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs, the lightning uh function? I I think so,	The latter would be preferable to implementing a backlight into the remote.
So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them. Some uh audio signal. Like uh home phones. m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function, if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things. Yeah.	It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it.
I think it's the same as in the cell phone, just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons,	Using them sparsely, as in mobile phones, could bring down the cost.
And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques, blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff. It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons. S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one. And um um yeah, some some fancy lights.	LED's can be used to light up the remote.
So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them. Some uh audio signal. Like uh home phones. I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote. There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment.	It's difficult to choose a technique to find a lost remote.
they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also. Uh no, they're uh they're a little bit more expensive,	Power-saving LED's are available, but these could be more expensive.
if we use the LEDs, i does it use much more energy	LED's would signify extra energy consumption.
And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge, then there wouldn't be uh a big problem.	A recharging cradle can be added to compensate for the extra energy consumption.
but I want um the kind of functions, for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting. when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control, uh it's very easy to change uh the channel. That's one thing. but keep the programme and the volume, It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons. S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one. And um um yeah, some some fancy lights.	The remote will also include volume and program selection, and speech recognition.
Dual channel watch.	Another button to switch between two channels could also be implemented.
It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions. Instead of a stick. just a round uh button should be the trick, I think.	A single, large, round button can be used for both volume and channel selection by using the four separate quadrants.
do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might, 'cause young people uh like new features.	It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition.
The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times, And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control.	Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose.
And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set. The user interface connected to a chip, which is connected to the sender, which generates messages using uh infrared light,	The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.
But my in my opinion, the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us.	The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one.
But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated	Adding such features may complicate the design and escalate costs.
And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques, blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff. It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons. S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one. And um um yeah, some some fancy lights.	The remote could light up via LED's placed inside.
But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_. Just a little antenna or uh something. just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility. But that will be very costly, I think.	Similarly, using an extra base station would probably be too costly.
personally I think we should infra use infrared, Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse, friendly components. Um for cost-effectiveness, we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board,	The use of infrared, energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested.
maybe maybe like clapping in your hands, Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds.	They cannot install a special button on a TV, and using a special signal, like clapping, is tricky, because it needs to be differentiated from normal sounds.
Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty,	The target group will be people below 40.
the new project requirements, but we should not um support teletext in the remote, Um the remote control should only be used for television, then for Roo, as well uh important, the corporate image should be recognisable in our product.	There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.
I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching.	The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends.
User Interface Designer, uh Roo, I would like to see the user interface c uh concept.	The UI will present the user interface concept.
Um the Interface Designer, um I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept.	The ID will present the components concept.
although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh Profitable. We we yeah, we still need to take in account the the bit older people.	An expanded target group may have to be taken into account in order to achieve the projected sales and profits.
Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder.	The project manager will add the minutes into the project folder.
Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution,	The industrial designer will look into what would be an appropriate technology to help users find their remote, when it is lost.
but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly.	However, this solution may prove too expensive.
but I want um the kind of functions, for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting. Dual channel watch. when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control, uh it's very easy to change uh the channel. That's one thing. but keep the programme and the volume, we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design.	The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels, volume, program selection, and speech recognition, with a focus on simplicity of design.
maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control. when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control, uh it's very easy to change uh the channel. That's one thing.	The discussion also focused on their replacement with speech recognition, as the latter helps with locating the remote as well.
You c you can d make them very fancy	Despite that, customers may want them to be on a remote; furthermore, they can be designed in a more attractive way.
And and do we want um the ten digits? I wouldn't buy it personally. A remote control without the ten digits. But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull. Uh If if we would um drop the ten digits	There was a challenge regarding the need of the digit channels, based on the fact that they are not often used, and they also look dull.
So if you want the spongy feel, you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber.	It was debated that customers may prefer a total spongy texture, not just in the buttons and the sides of the remote.
What about uh the finishing of the case? Yeah, with colourful rubber. because they're they're rubber too. we should have it the other way around, I guess. A plastic cover with rubber finishing. What about um making this rubber and making this plastic? I'm I'm not so sure,	The front could have a rubber finish, or the buttons will be made of rubber.
it should be a full colour cover with such an image but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device.	Printing an image on the remote to make it more colourful is doable, but cannot be done by the manufacturing department.
Yeah, although I don't think that's very colourful. Except for the yellow of course,	The company colours (grey and yellow and black) did not seem sufficiently bright and trendy to everyone.
But but do we want the curved uh uh design, So I think this is the best of two worlds. Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample. Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker. Um with a with a regular chip. And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels. Uh you talked about it before, the colours, grey and yellow. The casing is curved, single-curved. and I think we should use the company colours. Something like black and red. uh black and yellow. The scroll-heel. Yes, the voice recognition we already decided.	The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition, in black and yellow, the company colours.
Um I guess you two have to figure that out.	The ID and UI will also have to figure out whether to use rubber just for the buttons and side finish, or for the whole front of the remote.
Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product. I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian.	They will also try to find a way to promote the corporate identity in the design of the look and feel and interface.
Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard.	The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype.
we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls. Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply. And we of course have the traditional uh solar power,	Hand or kinetic dynamos, batteries, and solar cells can be used as energy sources.
um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels. Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays, this is my volume button. And I can either on this side or this side um And click it to muten the device.	Possible interfaces are push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCDs. A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute.
And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels. The scroll-heel. Yes,	A scroll wheel will be included in the design.
You could make a few v very colourful ones, and uh a very traditional co cover. or uh like cell phones, exch exchangeable covers.	Changeable covers for the remote control can link the product to current fashion trends, but also trends followed by other age groups.
We have the uncurved or flat case. Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh We have uh a curved one. which is curved in three dimension.	Cases can be flat, single- or double-curved.
We can use plastic, We can use wood and titanium. uh which is the same for rubber,	They can be made of plastic, rubber, wood or titanium.
And for you, the product evaluation.	The marketing expert will carry out a product evaluation.
And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker,	Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote.
So it it needs to be rubber. But but do we want the curved uh uh design, So I think this is the best of two worlds. The casing is curved, single-curved. Yeah, with colourful rubber.	A single-curved rubber casing can also be used.
Traditional batteries uh and solar.	The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells.
And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes, shoes and furniture, and that they want spongy material. or uh like cell phones, exch exchangeable covers. You could make a few v very colourful ones, and uh a very traditional co cover.	The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote, and could also provide themes for other target groups.
maybe it rubber And what I'm thinking about, maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip	They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device.
Ease of use is important, but uh innovation is more important, and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important.	For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use.
Traditional batteries uh and solar.	The preferred energy source was a combination of batteries and solar cells.
d did we already decide on the display? No. I don't think you need it. And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part.	LCD is not going to be implemented.
according to Ruud, the the the market likes um new flashy technology, Uh I think our customers will go insane.	LCD screens may add an extra hi-tech touch, but given all the other features, it might be too much.
what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue. It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device.	Using the speech recognition on the device may not be convenient, since the remote will have to pointing towards the TV at the same time for the infrared to work.
I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it. There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel.	The use of a scroll wheel with integrated button was debated, as not everyone was convinced of its use for this project.
But if you're watching a movie, how many times uh you take the the remote control and and But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy.	It is not clear whether a kinetic dynamo can be used, because it is unlikely that a user shakes the remote enough, as one would do with similarly powered watches.
M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition, or train the voice voice recognition. okay. Okay, yeah, that's right. Or something li like that.	An extra button could activate/deactivate the voice recognition.
But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs.	The delay in providing costs of components was criticised.
The production costs. Twenty two. th this design is not um within our price model.	The prototype proved extremely over budget.
we need to redesign uh the product.	The prototype will have to be redesigned, so that it is compatible with the budget constraints..
And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell. um by not using the voice recognition feature,	The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition.
Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device. Definitely not, no.	The device cannot be a hi-tech, innovative one any more.
Is it? Is it fancy? just give it a two. was it innovative? I think uh it's a two. Is it easy to use? so it will be a two point five. Is it easy to find? but I personally give it a one. The feel of the remote control is spongy. and make this a one point five. The remote control offers enough features. I'll give it uh a one. For for the for this t uh type of market, I think it's a one.	The criteria used were fancifulness (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (2.5), whether it is easy to find (1), sponginess (1.5), number of features (1).
uh by giving it another colour already. Although I think we yeah, but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people	One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design.
we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation. About the project itself, not about the product. looking at room for creativity, there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow. Uh leadership. Fantastic. I think we're a good team. I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh, hey Roo uh. Um the means, the SMARTboard, the digital pen. Did you like 'em? Uh. The digital pen was okay, but SMARTboard was really bad. The drawing cap capabilities are very limited.	Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory, but the digital pens were alright, but not too useful).
we are evaluating this this uh design now. This prototype.	After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad).
uh maybe not not all that fancy, but just way way more easy uh uh um basic but that's not what uh has been asked.	It was suggested that they go for a completely simple design so as to maximise the profit, although this was not what was asked in the project requirements.
A a and the voice recognition as well, it's it's it's another approach,	It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface.
but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find.	The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well.
And and the case is is rubber? And the buttons? Plastic or rubber. Uh yellow with uh grey or black or something like that. Whatever cost uh cost uh the least.	The rubber case is yellow with grey or black, with buttons either made of plastic or rubber.
The production costs. Twenty two.	It would cost 22 euros.
It becomes a very dull remote control, I know. I think we we we all know what the redesign should be. A simple, dull, uh one-coloured box.	The team thought all the changes to accommodate the budget requirements made a very dull device.
The production costs. Twenty two. th this design is not um within our price model.	The prototype proved extremely over budget.
um then I did the following changes. Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells,	The idea to include a solar cell as a power source had to be abandoned, due to the escalated costs.
um by not using the voice recognition feature,	The same happened with the speech recognition.
First step will be the functional design. Anyway, we'll take this project in three steps, three pha uh three phase of design.	The project will be completed with three further meetings: the following meeting concerns the functional design.
so to help with these, you have we have the SMARTboards here. I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board, just stuff that you wanna share, just put it in the in the project folder,	The project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available.
we need design a remote control for television set, which has to be original, trendy and user-friendly. The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control.	The goal of the project is to design an original, trendy and user-friendly remote control for TV.
I'll be your Project Manager for today, for this project. Um I will be uh Pr Project the Marketing Expert. User Interface Designer. I'm the Industrial Designer,	The team comprises the project manager, the marketing expert, who is looking at user needs, the user interface designer, looking at usability, and the industrial designer, working on the engineering and materials.
What are y What are your first ideas for the new product? Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh, yeah, to be able to use it as well? but I think it's a little take it into consideration. is uh the the material it is made of, it should be something light.	Afterwards, they discussed briefly their first ideas, including the use of light materials and usability concerns.
is uh the the material it is made of, it should be something light.	They also agreed to choose light materials.
No rational changes or whatever, 'cause it revolutionary changes, so very intuitive design, I guess.	The design should generally be intuitive without changes that would render it an unfamiliar object to customers.
Selling price, twenty five Euros. The production price, twelve and a half Euros, approximately.	The remote  needs to be produced for 12.50 euros in order to be sold for double that amount.
gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot. So, draw us your favourite animal. It's supposed to be a dolphin, I like the elephant. the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger. I introduce to the world the amazing ant.	The whole team tried out the SMARTboard, by drawing their favourite animals.
Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh, yeah, to be able to use it as well? but I think it's a little take it into consideration.	The team will also take into account possible usability issues concerning disabled people.
we need design a remote control for television set, The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control.	The remote is just going to be for TV.
And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition.	They like innovative technology like speech recognition and LCD screens.
Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while.	Symbols on remotes fade with time.
just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big,	The most used buttons are going to be placed on top.
that was in the test, the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control,	It also transpires that remotes are easy to lose.
then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not,	The industrial designer wondered whether the remote should be universal or programmable.
so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it. So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere	Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design, and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes.
but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s. Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu. If it isn't, then we cannot reach it. But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu. Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that, so we know that for sure?	Different TVs have different functions incorporated in their built-in menus, making it hard to know in advance which buttons you can do without on the remote.
There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear.	The need for clarity of button functions was mentioned.
Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu, I don't think so.	It may not be technically possible for a universal remote control to create menus for various advanced settings on the TV itself.
Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote? to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_. Could be flat, you could insert your uh remote into it.	It might be possible to use a charger for the remote.
you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable.	On the other hand, materials should be more durable.
Think it's like this. and since you're holding it like this, I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own. Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle. Yeah, in the middle. uh the power button somewhere over here? I think it should be at the bottom somewhere. Mute. Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection. Where would we want the uh teletext button? Do we put it somewhere over here? Do we put the volume control and the channel control here, In the middle. Maybe in a circle for example, like we like in this example. but we do agree that we keep this at the centre, I think the channel button should be in the centre.	The team also discussed extensively the positioning of various buttons.
but just take a look at it,	He will also check into the importance and possibility of using rechargeable batteries and a charger.
The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor, that thinks over a Morse code, then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs. You have infrared	The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.
you have to come up with a components concept,	The ID will present the components concept.
And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition. Oh, we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then, with an L_C_D_ screen.	Consumers claim they would pay more for a remote with LCD screen, but adding the component might be too expensive.
Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people, um the younger people were defined under forty. And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable,	There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40, the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.
I'll put some on paper draw us up some some designs of of possible	He will also draw some ideas for the shape of the remote.
we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example. I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own. and since you're holding it like this, I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume Think it's like this. Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle. Yeah, in the middle. uh the power button somewhere over here? I think it should be at the bottom somewhere. Mute. Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection. Where would we want the uh teletext button? Do we put it somewhere over here? Do we put the volume control and the channel control here, In the middle. Maybe in a circle for example, like we like in this example. but we do agree that we keep this at the centre, I think the channel button should be in the centre.	They drew some of their ideas, and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the LCD.
Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote? I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive, But I think that will cost a lot. I'm not sure if it costs a lot,	Using a charger for the remote may be too expensive.
'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too. Speech recognition, I think it's very hard, Oh, we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then, with an L_C_D_ screen.	Speech recognition and LCD screens could be added to the remote control, but they might be too expensive for this project.
they want to spend money for a better system, for better remote control,	Customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes.
just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big,	The important buttons will be on top.
Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever. And uh with different colours uh. we should do a little thing about design, Different colours maybe. And the design, it should differ.	The remote will need to be different from those available in the market in terms of shape and colour.
This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people, um the younger people were defined under forty.	The target group will be people below 40.
And possibly also the size, so more important buttons, bigger you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable. just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big, we don't want we want very little buttons, just the buttons you use a lot.	Buttons should be made bigger, with clearly defined functions and of durable materials to avoid fading of the symbols.
And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable,	The company colours and slogan will have to be shown on the device.
I think the p yeah, the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement, just make a button on your T_V_ we should go for that. Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it, if you if it's lost, for people that are deaf. We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up. We could do that.	A button that sticks on the TV could be pressed to make the lost remote beep, and perhaps also light up.
so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it. this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols, locator, a sound, So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere	It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it.
For example, if your buttons are faded, after I mean if you make a durable remote, they are faded, you can just buy a new cover.	Because symbols may fade, the additional covers could include those.
I think it's universal. I think we should go for universal,	The remote is going to be a universal one.
I have to check that out, Yeah, just look at the possibilities then, Just to do research into both, w what it costs and what it takes for space.	The team will also examine whether they can use an LCD and/or speech recognition.
you should do some trend-watching, Could you post some other essentials of what people want,	The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends and see into the financial issues concerning the integration of a charger.
If you're reading from top to bottom, I think it's better to put it uh at the top. I I'm not sure. So we have three people saying it should be on top.	In the case where it is added, the issue would be whether to place it at the top or the bottom of the remote.
uh let's give this uh a name, and not like some vague serial number that no one understands, like with cars. Yeah, let's think of a name, okay.	Finally, they will try to think of a name for their product.
Prototype presentation, well first	The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design.
Basically in what we discussed, cover and buttons will be made of rubber, yellow colour, black components, We chose a different type of colour for the menu. A bit darker yellow	The rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus.
We chose the buttons to be uh teletext, okay button, favourite channel and the mute.	There are buttons for teletext, favourite channel, mute and OK.
I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time. There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them.	Everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment.
let's eval evaluate uh the product of us, our design. I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false	After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad).
So so the buttons, the look and feel. One and a half. And the next one uh yeah, when it's lost uh you can find it. so I think it that's that deserves a one. Definitely. And the next one. Manual. A three. So I might make this a two instead of a one, I guess. You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way. I mean the shape is trendy. Maybe we should go with a two then, mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition. 'Cause yeah, that gives you a seven,	The criteria used were look and feel (1), whether it is easy to find (1), whether it is easy to learn (2), use of LCD (3), speech recognition (7), trendiness (2).
You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display. we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor. The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway.	It incorporates both LCD screen and speech recognition.
For example, I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created. I think we did pretty well as team-work though. Because, yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime, Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher, So we cannot work on more than one page at same time. That's not possible.	Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time, the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time).
You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost,	The prototype proved over budget (17 euros).
Triple R_ it is.	Finally, the decided to call their design Triple-R.
have to write my report now, I guess.	The PM is going to finish the project report.
think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition.	The latter was taken out, along with the special colour.
Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report? Yeah, sure.	The UI and ID will send him their design to include.
Because, yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime,	The team were unable to communicate amongst themselves in between meetings, which hindered the flow of information.
so I had to take out the special colour I suppose. and if you want it if you want the custom design, then you can buy the separate covers. I think the colour is more important than the really the curve, but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers. I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect	There was disagreement over whether the special colour should be scrapped and the look to rely on the separate covers.
we could take out the curve. Can we then not also uh change the material? We take plastic for the basic cover I say lose the curve. Oh that's true,	Other solutions, like abandoning the curve of the casing or replace the rubber with plastic were also suggested.
So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen? uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half, so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half? and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company	They were also not allowed to raise the budget limit.
What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen? Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu, I thought that people wanted previews on their I don't think it's possible really. uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example, how do you configure that. So that could be done by L_C_D_ display. I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display. like I said, changing channels, everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display, so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything.	The precise use of the LCD was not defined: it could be used for TV configuration, or, if possible, for displaying the TV programme and previews.
I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool. Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher,	Although the SMARTboard was useful to draw ideas quickly , it could be improved in terms of response time.
So we cannot work on more than one page at same time. That's not possible.	Similarly, the digital pens did not allow the user to work on more than one page at a time.
think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition. You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost,	Because the prototype was over budget, the team decided to take out the speech recognition from the design.
I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect Yeah. I would say I would agree with you on the colour, we're final on that.	They also discarded the special colour, and decided to rely on the changeable covers for an attractive look.
Triple R_ it is.	The remote control is going to be called Triple-R.
You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost,	The production cost was 17 euros, 4.5 more than the budget.
What do we scrap.	It was imperative that some of the features had to be taken out.
